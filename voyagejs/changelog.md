# voyagejs changelog

> ui is a function of states `ui = f(states)`

> the date after the version number is its release date (utc+8)

> version 0.xx: the framework being written, no static api

## 0.23

- better and safer state
  - in fn sync
  - instead of state=obj(initial) state={}
  - state.v for the value
  - state for the state obj carrying cid sid
- label updater
  - in fn createNode
  - {label:state} -> bind single state to label
  - updateLabel(node,label,state){...}
  - bind(updateLabel,state)
- revise fn macros.model
  - add node.value=state.v
  - no need to write {value:state,"@model":state}
  - write {"@model":state} instead
- label updater example
  - examples[counterLabel]
  - label:state will only bind state change to label
  - it wont listen label.content change to update state

## 0.24

- label updater with multi factors
  - {label:calc(fn,...[factor states])}
  - or calc(fn,[factor states]) -> a reducer like useMemo in react
  - return obj {calculator:fn,factors:[...arr]}
  - updateLabelCalc(node,label,calculator){...}
  - map factors bind(updLabelCalc,factor)

## 0.25

  - to info components and selections
  - states stay unchanged
  - because states["global"] acts the same as states[cid]

  - after: changelog is a separated markdown file
- removed ugly abstraction especially those only used once after definition
  - `refactor`
  - removed the "use" function
  - refactored the "include" function
    - before: "const {slice} = include(Array)"
      - the "include" fn returns a proxy of constructor's prototype.
    - after: "const {slice} = include("slice")"
      - slice(arr,...args) // arr.slice(...args)
  - renamed "include" "use"

## 0.30 20250201

- revised some jsdoc comment
  - `docs`
  - including the example of "voyage.lib.use" fn

  - and others (made them clearer)
- removed voyage.lib.symbol()
  - `refactor`
  - defined but never used in current version
- removed voyage.memorize fn and its dependencies
  - `refactor`
  - see "ref1"

  - revised voyage.select fn
  - removed voyage.get (no reference or comment)
  - removed voyage.lookup (no reference or comment)
- split compile and create fn
  - `refactor`
  - write compile fn for json
    - write a sub fn: recursion(...arr)
    - iterate the arr,
    - if it's the first str then consider it type otherwise contents
    - if it's an obj, consider it labels
    - if it's an arr, init contents [] and push recursion(it).
    - if no str appears, consider type "div"
    - just use recursion. an element shouldnt be that large.
    - returns element {str type,obj labels,arr|str contents}
    - (upd: type can be function, as component)
  - rewrite create fn
    - write a sub fn recursion(element)
    - create a node of element.type
    - give it componentid.
    - if there is macros on labels, bind them to componentid.
    - if the contents is str, then set innerText
    - otherwise iterate contents, recursion and appendChild.
    - just use recursion. an element shouldnt be that large.
    - returns node
- rewrite c fn
  - `alias`
  - create fn includes compile fn before, now doesn't
  - so let c(...) equal to create(compile(...))
  - to make the code work

## 0.31 20250316

- docs: add jsdoc comments to existing code
- refactor: some unused functions
- refactor: merge voyage.info into voyage.counter
- style: change syntax of private functions
  - from `const { a } = { a() {} };`
  - to `const a = function () {};`
  - the former one omits `function` at the cost of redundant indentation and the repetition of `a`
- refactor: merge voyage.states into voyage.components
  - from `voyage.states[componentid]` to `voyage.components[componentid].states`
  - more semantic now
- refactor: voyage.ref and voyage.store
  - fn(...options) is awkward, changed to fn(initial, stateid)
  - both param are optional
- refactor: merge voyage.getState into voyage.ref
- style: rename some component life cycle fn
  - component: create, show, update.
  - state: ref (create state), set (change state), apply (apply new value).
  - inspired by react (mount, update, unmount)
- refactor: voyage.lib.use
  - changed its implementation to proxy
  - now it doesnt rely on method name, and can return all methods at once
- feat: change event listener of @model macro to "input"
  - not "change"
  - inspired by vue model
- refactor: change inner text to text node
  - a node can contain both text nodes and other nodes

## 0.32 20250321

- feat: replace innertext with textcontent
  - faster and preserve formatting
- refactor: remove newvalue param on `apply`
  - and oldvalue is optional now
- refactor: remove `keep` and `"global"` componentid
  - no reference, and number componentid works well
- refactor: merge updaters into components
  - `components[cid].states[sid].updaters`
- refactor: `lib.init`
  - previous one is too complex logic
  - replace voyage.lib.lacks with !voyage.lib.has
- refactor: remove `store`
  - use `a = ref(...); bind(a, update())` instead
  - store and ref are `useState` and `useRef` in react
  - now store feels redundant
  - inspired by svelte vue
- style: rename `call` to `render`
- fix: `class` label doesnt take effect
  - replace with `className`

## 0.33 (not released)

- (wip)
- chore: read svelte examples
  - learn from it
  - define stable apis to release version 1.0
- chore: read tailwindcss docs
  - learn from it
  - define theming features
- feat(state): `aftercreate` and delay state changes on the fly
  - state changes wont apply when the component is in `create` status. these stateids will be put into `components[cid].afterCreate`. after create the component, apply all changes and clear todo.
  - eg. a component store internet resources in a state, show loading until data is fetched.
  - inspired by react `useEffect`
- feat(theming): `defineTheme()`, `useTheme()`, `@style` macro.
  - `defineTheme(obj theme)`
    - theme includes obj, str, fn `{str|fn|[theme]:{str|fn}}`
    - obj `"c-1": {dark:"black", light: "white"}`
    - str `{bg: "background", bar: "perspective: 123"}`
    - fn `{w(v){return 100*v}}`
  - `useTheme(str theme)`
    - change global state theme
  - `@style`
    - {@style: "bg-c-1 br-2 color-black font-weight-w-1 foo hover:bar"}
    - split by " " into array of styles, for each style, split by "-"
    - bg is defined as string, converted to `"background"`
    - c is defined, and -1 is valid, converted by current theme
    - br and 2 are not defined, converted to `"br:2,"`
    - font and weight are not defined, stay still
    - w is defined, pass 1 to it, get 100, so `font-weight: 100`
    - foo is not defined, even without value, not taking effect
    - bar is defined using peusdo class
    - all these style will generate a murmurhash as classname in style element
    - the style element has state "theme" and "map" (hash: "br-2 ...")
  - inspired by tailwindcss, emotion, unocss, tachyons
- feat: `computed`, a special state
  - `voyage.computed(computation, ...factors)`
  - return a `computedState`
  - prop compute, fn(states)
  - prop factors, an array of states
  - prop value
  - get: value
  - set: no effect
  - binds all its factors to `recompute(){value=compute()}`
  - inspired by vue computed, immer, svelte derived
- feat: `bind` supports `remover` fn and multiple states
  - replace the param order to `bind(updater, ...states)`, more semantic ("bind a to b")
  - bind for each state
  - change the logic of calling updaters:
    - if the `isnt(prototype(updater).removerid, 0)`, call `component.removers[rid]`, then remove `component.removers[rid]` and reset removerid to 0
    - if the updater returns a fn, it will be put on `component.removers[component.removerid++]` and put removerid to its `prototype`
    - conclusion: remover will run when updater rerun or component is removed
  - inspired by svelte effect
- feat: `remove(cid)`, `family` and `component.children`
  - call all `voyage.components[cid].removers`
  - remove all children `component.children`
  - delete `voyage.components[cid]`
  - define `voyage.family`, when creating a component push it, when created pop it to its parent `component.children`
- refactor: use `prototype` to define reactive states info
  - using `obj.getprototypeof` and `set...`
  - including `componentid`, `stateid`
- feat: `ref` supports deep state, and `snap` `raw`
  - objects ref doesnt need .value now, just use as normal object, it's a proxy
  - `snap` can turn the proxy into a normal object (by cloning)
  - `raw` is for large arrays, just reference the object and add state info to its prototype. need to apply it specially for any changes.
  - inspired by svelte state.raw state.snapshot
- refactor: `$` label
  - remove voyage selections
  - $: state, define the element as the state value
  - the state should be raw({}), and Object.assign will be used.
  - inspired by svelte bind
- feat: `aftershow` and `effect(effect, ...states)`
  - `bind(effect,...states)` and put effect to `component.afterShow`
  - inspired by svelte effect
- feat: `load` a component `library`
  - no need to import or deconstruct child components
  - just load them, and use them as string
  - both functions and strings found in `library` are consider components
- feat: `html`, a tagged fn to copmuted state
  - `html(...state)` creates a component, and bind the state to its innerhtml
  - `html` can also be use as tagged fn
- feat: `text`, a tagged fn to computed state
  - text`Clicked ${count} ${computed(()=>count === 1 ? 'time' : 'times')}`
  - similar to `html`
  - inspired by svelte example: reactive assignments
- feat: `children` prop and `@content` macro, remove `@text` `@html`
  - during `compile`,
  - for components, children will be put into `children` prop
  - for nodes, if children contain state, the whole children will be converted to a compiled state of array, with these states as factors, put on `@content`
  - `@html` and `@text` are useless, being removed
- feat: `replace` fn diff with `key`
  - for each old, create key map `{key: {node, index}}`
  - for each new, if new one has key
    - if key exists, move old one and remove matched key
    - otherwise insert new one
    - remove leftover old nodes on key map
  - otherwise assign to old index
    - type match: labels (shallow), content (recursive), add to used list
    - unused (type not match or redundant nodes at the end): remove
  - inspired by vue, svelte each
- feat(diff): preserve focus in input element
  - no need to update dom when state changes
  - diff between the new component and real dom before `replace`
  - only affects `store`, not `ref`
  - inspired by svelte
- feat(key): list of counter that can be sorted
  - list component ref array counts and boolean isAscended
  - counter component has a prop count, which is created by pointer

## 0.34 20250401

- feat: `p(props)`, properties of a component
  - assign `passedprops` to `props`
  - returns a proxy, each key in obj becomes a fn

  - set (a param, not fn): set value, call all subscribers
  - set (a param, fn): pass current value, set returned value, call ...
    - a prop can not be set to undefined, if the fn returns undefined, consider some prop inside the state has changed (ref immer "produce")

## 1.0 20250818

- refactor!: removed all previous code. now voyagejs is a syntax sugar for preact.
  - why: a good web framework has a lot to do to optimize the performance. voyagejs need not reinvent the wheel. based on preact, voyagejs can focus on developer experience without caring the boring web apis.
  - another reason: virtual dom and fine grained reactivity are almost the same. to pursue elegance of code, voyagejs stuck to the latter choice, which update the minimal part of view without doing useless work, for a long time. but now after consulting llm, i came to the idea that the two choices have similar performance in most cases while virtual dom is far more intuitive for me. and the elegance of code, is not so important for me now.
- feat!: voyagejs utilities from vue
  - v-on / @ (done)
  - v-html / dangerouslySetInnerHTML (done)
  - v-model -> bind (done)
  - class arr obj & style obj with kabeb case (done)
  - ref / useref (done)
  - v-show (done)
  - computed/usememo (?)
  - v-if, v-for / {condition && <Component />} (rejected) (rejected)
  - watch/useEffect (rejected)
  - Slots/props.children (rejected)
  - <style scoped> (rejected)
  - Custom Directives (v-tooltip, v-click-outside) (rejected)
  - Reactivity System (Automatic Dependency Tracking) Vue’s reactivity is automatic—no need for useState or useEffect to track changes. (rejected)
  - Single File Components (SFCs) Vue’s .vue files combine template, script, and styles in one file. React typically separates JSX, logic, and styles into different files. (rejected)
  - Built-in Transition Effects (<transition>) (rejected)
  - provide / inject (Dependency Injection) / createContext and useContext (rejected)
  - v-once (rejected)
  - v-pre (rejected)
- test: split voyagejs core library and its unit tests to two js files

## 1.1 20250901

- feat: all memo
  - since voyagejs, a simple framework, doesnt support memo, i have to choose between all memo and no memo.
  - i ve asked llm: if i have to choose between all memo and no memo, which is better. llm suggested all memo.
- library: include preact compat for memo
- style: clearer syntax for done todos
  - before: `todo: ... (done)`
  - after: `done: ...`
- fix!: infinite loop when there is a ref prop
- feat(test): run all unit tests at the same time
  - display all component examples on the page
- fix(test): global var and wrong deps
  - in component `IntervalEffect` and `Condition`, i accidentally missed `let/const` before a variable. it becomes global even in a fn. that's one of js's most infamous "features".
  - effects for setting intervals have deps, it adds overhead which may cause inaccurate timing.

## 1.2 20250901

- fix: ref will cause unnecessary rerender
  - voyagejs doesnt support useref for simplicity. i use state as ref. the solution is to silently set the state's value without calling setstate.
- feat: prop.current
  - make the current value public for silently setting state.
  - getting and setting .current will not create rerenders.

## 1.3 20250901

- fix!: ref couldnt keep across different renders
  - directly setting prop.current wont let preact know. when it rerenders, current lose its value.
  - solution: useref instead of usestate under the hood. manually compare new and old state to decide whether to update. usereducer for force update.
  - remove prop.current
- feat: prop.mutate() for direct mutation without rerenders
  - element ref is passed to mutate

## 1.4 20250910

- fix: make useref safe for objects
  - ref will unexpectedly reapply initial values if ref.current doesnt change
  - if an object is passed to useref, while the ref is the dep of an effect. the effect will rerun every render whether or not the ref changes. because components are js fn, the same object will have different ref between two calls. 
  - now useref only set initial value in the first render.
- fix!: make prop deps in effect work properly
  - array.map() doesnt modify the original array
  - now using the processed deps array
- chore: remove meaningless dev period comment
  - "developed during (prev release date) to (release date)"

## 1.5 20250926

- refactor: put the global variable on globalthis instead of "const foo"
- docs: voyagejs prompt for llm
