societyirl: chinese homeless

"清风明月": things that are cheap/free, but shared across classes, races, etc. like the internet (google, chatgpt, wikipedia, reedit/twitter/telegram/4chan, etc.), z library (books), magnet (movies, music, softwares, etc.).

buy some electronic rubbishes on xianyu, a second shop powered by alibaba (a chinese leading e commerce guy)

install linux on that. give to the homeless for free.

- find, meet, and talk with the chinese homeless (educated/know the characters, have phone number, arete/no drugs/no illness, free/porn and gambling accepted)
- introduce the daoism, the useless tree
- (the laptop is already well prepared, using automation, like installing twitter normalizer chromium extension, adguard, tempermonkey)
- buy a 12cny/year airport (the github free nodes require some efforts/knowledge)
- register accounts on google, twitter, telegram
- follow lcmenci on twitter, and everyone she follows
- recommend local llms, magnet (with guide to imdb), z library, (tor), (unixporn).
- watch an episode (like ave mujica)
- give the laptop with a simple guide (like ctrl shift p in vscode, inspired by yanyan jiang).

the idea: living in the earth village, the gifts of humanity shared across the poor and the wealthy

project white.

see this on zlib "you are gonna get educated".

why.

knowledge is for problem solvers.

for the carefree ones like the homeless... idk.

the world is what it is. humans have no purpose.

science. that's science. education is a thing, a good thing. just a good thing.

the earth is already over populated. people are already over educated, holding a lot of useless knowledge, not transferable, not gonna get connected anywhere.

the world could not be changed.

no need to pursue freedom and democracy.

humans are already free. through whatever idea, knowledge (tech), etc. just about implementaion. but good things could not always be implemented.

be easy. take the best of both worlds.

existentialism, cynicism, solitude.
