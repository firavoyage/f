## firascript - the programming language

a script language fira would like.

### syntax

see syntax.md

### compiler

will fira implement this?

probably not.

coz the choices available are (not ideal but) good enough

so, it's just an idea.

### upd

2025.10.06

i suddenly realized that some syntax "boilerplates" do benefit readability.

like "=>" between params and fn.

sometimes idk whether it's good.

when reading, is it good to place ";" at the end of each line?

i will continue using javascript es6. 

split "=" and "==" may also enhance readability
