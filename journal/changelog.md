rename `resources/assets` to `resources`.

why: vscode has `resources` (icons, desktop files, distros) and `extensions` (built in extensions for languages). btw, resources feel more natural than assets (wealth, luxury, quality).

rename `resources` to `extensions`.

gnome-extension and systemd is definitely extensions. it helps journal itself run.
