the relationship of messages

some ideas:

(normalize before and after when needed for each step. e.g. check clarity/spec before trying to get real responses, polish and apply styling before showing to the user, for each message generate 3 responses and pick one, etc.)

plan -> do (give what, do what, how to verify) -> plan (call tools like test/ci? work or fail? how is it? move forward, iterate/try again, try new way, or give up) -> do (run a command? search? browse? given what do what) -> ... -> plan -> done

(normalize before and after when needed for each step)

plan -> do (give what, do what, how to verify) -> plan (how is it? move forward, iterate/try again, try new way, or give up) -> do -> ... -> plan -> done

it's linear.

creating an agentic continuous autonomy app called humility.

most existing products are close sourced. opensource ones are opinionated and unpolished. im not willing to work around.

I want it to be wise and graceful, which implies simplicity and effectiveness. I want it to feel me.

creating an agentic continuous autonomy app called humility.

i want it to feel me. i want it to just work.

that's it.

about feasibility: it's hard to compete or gain market share. but it's easy to make it work. and maybe it already works: on chatgpt site, i could do anything, although manually.

I want to leverage llms a bit more, they are free and somewhat useful. About humility, I want it to be wise and graceful, which implies simplicity and effectiveness. I want it to feel me.

The Feeling

- What bothered me
- What felt missing
- What kept returning to my thoughts

The Moment

- When I noticed it
- Where I was (context matters)
- What triggered the realization

The Curiosity

- “What if this were easier?”
- “Why does this still feel unsolved?”
- “What would I try if I wasn’t afraid?”

The Desire

- What I wish existed
- What I wish someone had built for me
- What kind of experience I want to create

The Meaning

- Why this matters to me personally
- What value I care about protecting
- What feels worth spending time on

The Direction (Very Soft)

- Who this might help
- What change I hope it creates
- What _kind_ of thing this wants to become

---

- intention
- polish

what's good: chromium, code.

Gesture: swipe between chats. Open in new page. Permalink. Swipe to switch branches. Edit/stop if wrong. Delete to feel peace of mind, to bin. 

A history. Undo each step. Any step, no need to also undo steps after it if not depending. Git merge.

on normalizing what user could see

remove:

- ofc, yes, absolutely
- repeating the requirement, claiming its confidence (e.g. adj. in paratheses)
- if you want/like/'d like

be pragmatic.

about mediocrity.

sometimes, most people are right

sometimes, most people are wrong. but there is science. and science speaks loudly, even in a deterministic way.

sometimes, most people are wrong. and things could not feel right unless being opinionated, even going extreme.
