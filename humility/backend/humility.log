2026-02-12T16:15:54.712Z Test response: Hey! 👋  
Short answer: quite a lot. Longer (but still friendly) answer—here’s a taste of what I’m good at:

- 🧠 **Explaining things** — from “ELI5” to deep dives (science, tech, history, finance, you name it)
- ✍️ **Writing & editing** — emails, essays, stories, resumes, scripts, captions
- 💡 **Brainstorming** — ideas for projects, content, names, gifts, plans
- 📚 **Learning help** — tutoring, summaries, study plans, practice questions
- 💻 **Tech & coding help** — debugging, examples, concepts, algorithms
- 🧭 **Planning** — trips, schedules, goals, workouts, routines
- 🎨 **Creative stuff** — poems, stories, roleplay, worldbuilding
- 🗣️ **Conversation** — thinking things through, getting unstuck, or just chatting

If you want, tell me:
- what you’re working on  
- or what you’re curious about  
- or just say “surprise me” 😄  

What do you feel like doing right now?
