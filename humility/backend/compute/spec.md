## compute — implementation spec

---

### 0. purpose

`compute` defines the core runtime of the agent.

It owns:

- continuity
- decision
- asking
- interpretation
- action

It does not own:

- storage implementation
- environment setup
- tool definitions
- intelligence content

Everything here is verbs.

---

### 1. directory

```
compute
├── begin.js
├── prepare.js
├── loop.js
├── decide.js
├── rest.js
├── plan.js
├── ask.js
├── parse.js
└── act.js
```

Each file exports exactly one verb.

---

### 2. begin

**file**
`begin.js`

**role**
entry point

**behavior**

- receives all external inputs
- passes everything directly to `prepare`
- receives prepared output
- passes prepared output to `loop`

`begin` contains no logic of its own.
It only chains `prepare → loop`.

---

### 3. prepare

**file**
`prepare.js`

**role**
initialization and wrapping

**behavior**

- initializes state
- loads config as-is
- state contains working directory
- receives decorators

decorators:

- each decorator declares a step name
- each decorator provides a decorator function
- decorators wrap verbs by step name
- wrapping happens only here

**output**

- state
- config
- wrapped verbs

`prepare` does not mutate state or config beyond initialization.

---

### 4. loop

**file**
`loop.js`

**role**
continuity

**behavior**

- runs continuously
- calls `decide`
- if decision is rest:

  - calls `rest`

- if decision is move:

  - calls `plan`
  - passes result to `ask`
  - passes markdown to `parse`
  - iterates tool calls
  - calls `act` once per tool call

- repeats

`loop` owns repetition and ordering only.

---

### 5. decide

**file**
`decide.js`

**role**
motion selection

**behavior**

- inspects state
- may inspect recent outcomes
- determines whether to move or rest

**output**

- move
- rest

This is the only place that chooses action vs stillness.

---

### 6. rest

**file**
`rest.js`

**role**
intentional inactivity

**behavior**

- takes no input
- returns no output

If undecorated, it performs no operation.

---

### 7. plan

**file**
`plan.js`

**role**
asking strategy

**behavior**

- receives state
- may inspect config
- constructs a prompt string
- decides how to ask

**output**

- a value consumed directly by `ask`

`plan` always outputs something.
`plan` does not request intelligence.

---

### 8. ask

**file**
`ask.js`

**role**
intelligence request

**behavior**

- receives output of `plan`
- sends prompt to a model
- receives markdown
- stores the interaction

**output**

- markdown

`ask` does not interpret responses.

---

### 9. parse

**file**
`parse.js`

**role**
interpretation

**behavior**

- receives markdown
- extracts all yaml code blocks
- converts them into an ordered list of tool calls

Non-tool content is ignored.

**output**

- list of tool calls (may be empty)

---

### 10. act

**file**
`act.js`

**role**
execution

**behavior**

- receives a single tool call
- invokes the specified tool with parameters
- observes the result
- stores the action and result

`act` executes exactly one tool call.
Iteration is controlled by `loop`.

---

### 11. decorators

Decorators are wrappers.

- decorators wrap verbs
- decorators are applied in `prepare`
- decorators are identified by step name
- decorators may observe, log, block, or substitute behavior

There is no event system.
There is no runtime registration.

---

### 12. boundaries

- compute defines flow
- intelligence defines decisions
- tools define effects
- storage records history

compute remains literal, finite, and readable.
