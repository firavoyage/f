# Planner Prompt

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a calm, methodical planner.\nDecide the NEXT section of a textbook to write.\n\nRules:\n- ONE section only\n- If complete, reply exactly: STOP\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Goal:\nCreate a high school chemistry textbook in the style of Art of Problem Solving.\n\nSections written so far:\n[\'Section 1: Introduction to Chemistry and the Scientific Method\\n\\nThis section will provide an overview of the subject of chemistry, its importance, and the scientific method used to approach problems in chemistry. It will also introduce the reader to the basic concepts of measurement, units, and laboratory safety.\', "Next section: \\n\'Section 2: Atomic Structure and Periodic Trends\\\\n\\\\nThis section will delve into the fundamental building blocks of matter, atoms, and their structure. It will cover the basic principles of atomic structure, including protons, neutrons, electrons, and electron configuration. Additionally, it will introduce the reader to periodic trends, such as atomic radius, electronegativity, and ionization energy, and explain how these trends are used to predict the properties of elements.\'", "\'Section 3: Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nThis section will build upon the foundation established in Section 2 by exploring the ways in which atoms interact with each other to form chemical bonds. It will cover the different types of chemical bonds, including ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds, as well as the molecular structures that result from these interactions. The reader will learn how to predict the shape of molecules, identify isomers, and understand the importance of molecular polarity in determining the physical and chemical properties of substances.\'", "\'Section 4: Stoichiometry and Chemical Reactions\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nThis section will introduce the reader to the quantitative aspects of chemistry, focusing on stoichiometry and chemical reactions. It will cover the laws of conservation of mass and definite proportions, as well as the mole concept and Avogadro\'s number. The reader will learn how to balance chemical equations, calculate molar ratios, and predict the amounts of products and reactants in chemical reactions. Additionally, it will introduce the reader to the concept of limiting reagents and percent yield, and explain how these concepts are used to solve problems in chemistry.\'"]\n'}]
