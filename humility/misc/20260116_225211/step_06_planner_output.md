'Section 6: Chemical Equilibrium and Acid-Base Chemistry\\
\\
This section will build upon the foundation established in Section 4 by exploring the concept of chemical equilibrium, including the laws of mass action and the equilibrium constant. It will cover the different types of chemical equilibria, such as acid-base equilibria, and explain how these equilibria are used to predict the properties of substances. The reader will learn how to write equilibrium expressions, calculate equilibrium constants, and predict the direction of chemical reactions. Additionally, it will introduce the reader to the concept of pH and pOH, and explain how these concepts are used to analyze and predict the behavior of acid-base systems.'
