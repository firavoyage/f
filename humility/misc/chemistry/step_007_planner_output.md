**Section 7: Acid-Base Chemistry**

**7.1 Introduction to Acid-Base Chemistry**

Acid-base chemistry is a fundamental concept in chemistry that describes the behavior of acids and bases. Understanding acid-base chemistry is essential for predicting the behavior of chemical systems and designing experiments.

**7.2 Definitions of Acids and Bases**

* Acids: substances that donate a proton (H+ ion) or accept an electron pair
* Bases: substances that accept a proton (H+ ion) or donate an electron pair

**7.3 pH and pOH**

* pH: a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution
* pOH: a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) in a solution

**7.4 Strong and Weak Acids and Bases**

* Strong acids: completely dissociate in water to produce H+ ions
* Weak acids: only partially dissociate in water to produce H+ ions
* Strong bases: completely dissociate in water to produce OH- ions
* Weak bases: only partially dissociate in water to produce OH- ions

**7.5 Acid-Base Reactions**

* Neutralization reactions: reactions between acids and bases that produce water and a salt
* Acid-base equilibrium: reactions between acids and bases that reach a balance between reactants and products

**7.6 Buffers and pH Control**

* Buffers: solutions that resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added
* pH control: methods for controlling the pH of a solution, such as using buffers or adjusting the concentration of acid or base.

This is the seventh section of our high school chemistry textbook.
