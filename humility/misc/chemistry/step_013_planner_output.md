**Section 13: Biochemistry**

**13.1 Introduction to Biochemistry**

Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes that occur within living organisms. It is a branch of chemistry that deals with the structure, function, and interactions of biomolecules, such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.

**13.2 Biomolecules**

Biomolecules are the building blocks of life. They are composed of atoms and molecules that are arranged in specific ways to perform specific functions. There are four main types of biomolecules:

* Carbohydrates: provide energy for the body
* Proteins: perform a wide range of functions, including catalysis, transport, and structure
* Lipids: provide energy and help to regulate cell membrane structure
* Nucleic acids: store and transmit genetic information

**13.3 Metabolic Pathways**

Metabolic pathways are the series of chemical reactions that occur within living organisms to produce energy and synthesize biomolecules. There are two main types of metabolic pathways:

* Catabolic pathways: break down biomolecules to produce energy
* Anabolic pathways: synthesize biomolecules from simpler molecules

**13.4 Enzymes**

Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions within living organisms. They are highly specific and can be affected by a variety of factors, including temperature, pH, and the presence of inhibitors or activators.

**13.5 Genetic Information**

Genetic information is stored in the form of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. It is transmitted from one generation to the next and is used to determine the characteristics of an organism.

**13.6 Biotechnology**

Biotechnology is the application of biological principles to develop new products and technologies. It has a wide range of applications, including medicine, agriculture, and environmental science.

This is the thirteenth section of our high school chemistry textbook.
