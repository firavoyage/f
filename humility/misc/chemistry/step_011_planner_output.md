**Section 11: Organic Chemistry**

**11.1 Introduction to Organic Chemistry**

Organic chemistry is a branch of chemistry that deals with the study of carbon-based compounds. It is a fundamental concept in chemistry that helps us understand the behavior of molecules and design experiments.

**11.2 Structure and Bonding in Organic Compounds**

* Introduction to the structure of organic compounds, including functional groups and isomers
* Understanding the types of bonds in organic compounds, including covalent bonds and ionic bonds
* Introduction to the concept of electronegativity and its effect on bond polarity

**11.3 Functional Groups and Isomerism**

* Introduction to functional groups, including alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, and alkynyl groups
* Understanding the concept of isomerism, including structural isomerism and stereoisomerism
* Introduction to the concept of chirality and its importance in organic chemistry

**11.4 Alkanes and Cycloalkanes**

* Introduction to the structure and properties of alkanes and cycloalkanes
* Understanding the types of reactions that occur in alkanes and cycloalkanes, including substitution reactions and elimination reactions
* Introduction to the concept of alkane stability and its relationship to molecular structure

**11.5 Alkenes and Alkynes**

* Introduction to the structure and properties of alkenes and alkynes
* Understanding the types of reactions that occur in alkenes and alkynes, including addition reactions and elimination reactions
* Introduction to the concept of alkene and alkyne stability and its relationship to molecular structure

This is the eleventh section of our high school chemistry textbook.
