**Section 14: Analytical Chemistry**

**14.1 Introduction to Analytical Chemistry**

Analytical chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the analysis and identification of chemical substances. It is a fundamental concept in chemistry that helps us understand the composition and properties of matter.

**14.2 Types of Analytical Techniques**

There are several types of analytical techniques, including:

* Spectroscopy: the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation
* Chromatography: the separation of mixtures based on the interaction between the components and a stationary phase
* Electrochemistry: the study of the relationship between chemical reactions and electricity
* Mass spectrometry: the study of the mass-to-charge ratio of ions

**14.3 Quantitative Analysis**

Quantitative analysis is the process of determining the amount of a substance in a sample. It involves the use of analytical techniques, such as spectroscopy and chromatography, to measure the concentration of a substance.

**14.4 Qualitative Analysis**

Qualitative analysis is the process of identifying the presence of a substance in a sample. It involves the use of analytical techniques, such as spectroscopy and chromatography, to determine the identity of a substance.

**14.5 Calibration and Standardization**

Calibration and standardization are essential steps in analytical chemistry. Calibration involves the process of adjusting the analytical instrument to ensure that it is functioning correctly, while standardization involves the process of establishing a reference point for the analysis.

**14.6 Error Analysis**

Error analysis is the process of evaluating the accuracy and precision of analytical results. It involves the use of statistical methods to determine the uncertainty of the results.

This is the fourteenth section of our high school chemistry textbook."
