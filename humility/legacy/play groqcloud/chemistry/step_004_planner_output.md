**Section 4: Chemical Reactions**

**4.1 Introduction to Chemical Reactions**

Chemical reactions are a fundamental aspect of chemistry that describe the transformation of one or more substances into new substances. Understanding chemical reactions is essential for understanding the properties and behavior of elements and compounds.

**4.2 Types of Chemical Reactions**

There are several types of chemical reactions, including:

* Synthesis reactions: reactions in which two or more substances combine to form a new substance.
* Decomposition reactions: reactions in which a single substance breaks down into two or more substances.
* Replacement reactions: reactions in which one substance displaces another substance from a compound.
* Combustion reactions: reactions in which a substance reacts with oxygen to produce heat and light.
* Acid-base reactions: reactions in which an acid and a base react to form a salt and water.

**4.3 Stoichiometry**

Stoichiometry is the study of the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions. Understanding stoichiometry is essential for understanding the properties and behavior of elements and compounds.

**4.4 Chemical Equations**

Chemical equations are a way of representing chemical reactions using symbols and formulas. Understanding chemical equations is essential for understanding the properties and behavior of elements and compounds.

**4.5 Limiting Reactants and Percent Yield**

Limiting reactants and percent yield are important concepts in chemistry that describe the relationship between the amount of reactants and products in a chemical reaction. Understanding these concepts is essential for understanding the properties and behavior of elements and compounds.

**4.6 Catalysts and Reaction Rates**

Catalysts and reaction rates are important concepts in chemistry that describe the factors that affect the rate of a chemical reaction. Understanding these concepts is essential for understanding the properties and behavior of elements and compounds.
