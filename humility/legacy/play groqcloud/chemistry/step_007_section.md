**Section 7: Acid-Base Chemistry**

### 7.1 Introduction to Acid-Base Chemistry

Acid-base chemistry is a fundamental concept in chemistry that describes the behavior of acids and bases. Understanding acid-base chemistry is essential for predicting the behavior of chemical systems and designing experiments. Acid-base chemistry plays a crucial role in various fields, including biology, medicine, and environmental science.

In this chapter, we will explore the definitions of acids and bases, the concepts of pH and pOH, strong and weak acids and bases, acid-base reactions, and the importance of buffers and pH control.

### 7.2 Definitions of Acids and Bases

In chemistry, acids and bases are defined based on their behavior in aqueous solutions. The Arrhenius definition, which is a simplified version of the Bronsted-Lowry and Lewis definitions, is commonly used in high school chemistry.

* **Acids**: substances that donate a proton (H+ ion) or accept an electron pair. Examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and acetic acid (CH3COOH).
* **Bases**: substances that accept a proton (H+ ion) or donate an electron pair. Examples of bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), and ammonia (NH3).

### 7.3 pH and pOH

pH and pOH are two important concepts in acid-base chemistry that describe the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-) in a solution, respectively.

* **pH**: a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral.
* **pOH**: a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) in a solution. The pOH scale is related to the pH scale by the equation: pH + pOH = 14.

### 7.4 Strong and Weak Acids and Bases

Acids and bases can be classified as strong or weak based on their behavior in aqueous solutions.

* **Strong acids**: completely dissociate in water to produce H+ ions. Examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and nitric acid (HNO3).
* **Weak acids**: only partially dissociate in water to produce H+ ions. Examples of weak acids include acetic acid (CH3COOH), citric acid (C6H8O7), and carbonic acid (H2CO3).
* **Strong bases**: completely dissociate in water to produce OH- ions. Examples of strong bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), and potassium hydroxide (KOH).
* **Weak bases**: only partially dissociate in water to produce OH- ions. Examples of weak bases include ammonia (NH3), methylamine (CH3NH2), and ethylamine (C2H5NH2).

### 7.5 Acid-Base Reactions

Acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton (H+ ion) from an acid to a base, resulting in the formation of a salt and water.

* **Neutralization reactions**: reactions between acids and bases that produce water and a salt. Examples of neutralization reactions include the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H2O).
* **Acid-base equilibrium**: reactions between acids and bases that reach a balance between reactants and products. Examples of acid-base equilibria include the equilibrium between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and water (H2O) to form hydrogen ions (H+) and acetate ions (CH3COO-).

### 7.6 Buffers and pH Control

Buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added.

* **Buffers**: solutions that resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. Examples of buffers include the phosphate buffer (H2PO4- / HPO42-) and the bicarbonate buffer (HCO3- / CO32-).
* **pH control**: methods for controlling the pH of a solution, such as using buffers or adjusting the concentration of acid or base.

In the next chapter, we will explore the concept of redox reactions and how they relate to acid-base chemistry.
