'Section 3: Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure\\
\\
This section will build upon the foundation established in Section 2 by exploring the ways in which atoms interact with each other to form chemical bonds. It will cover the different types of chemical bonds, including ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds, as well as the molecular structures that result from these interactions. The reader will learn how to predict the shape of molecules, identify isomers, and understand the importance of molecular polarity in determining the physical and chemical properties of substances.'
