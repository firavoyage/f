**Section 4: Stoichiometry and Chemical Reactions**
=====================================================

### 4.1 Introduction to Stoichiometry
------------------------------------

Stoichiometry is the quantitative study of the amounts of substances involved in chemical reactions. It's a crucial aspect of chemistry that allows us to predict the amounts of products and reactants in chemical reactions, calculate molar ratios, and determine the limiting reagent. In this section, we'll delve into the world of stoichiometry and explore the laws that govern it.

### 4.2 The Laws of Conservation of Mass and Definite Proportions
---------------------------------------------------------

#### 4.2.1 The Law of Conservation of Mass

The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. This means that the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

m (reactants) = m (products)

where m represents mass.

#### 4.2.2 The Law of Definite Proportions

The law of definite proportions states that a chemical compound always contains the same proportion of elements by mass, regardless of its source or method of preparation. This means that a given compound will always have the same composition, regardless of where it comes from.

### 4.3 The Mole Concept and Avogadro's Number
---------------------------------------------

#### 4.3.1 The Mole

The mole is a unit of measurement that represents 6.022 x 10^23 particles (atoms or molecules). This number is known as Avogadro's number. The mole is a convenient unit of measurement because it allows us to easily convert between mass and number of particles.

#### 4.3.2 Avogadro's Number

Avogadro's number is a fundamental constant in chemistry that represents the number of particles in one mole of a substance. It's a critical concept in stoichiometry, as it allows us to calculate the number of particles in a given mass of a substance.

### 4.4 Balancing Chemical Equations
--------------------------------------

A balanced chemical equation is one in which the number of atoms of each element is the same on both the reactant and product sides. Balancing chemical equations is a crucial step in stoichiometry, as it allows us to determine the molar ratios of reactants and products.

### 4.5 Molar Ratios and Stoichiometry
--------------------------------------

Molar ratios are the ratios of the number of moles of reactants and products in a chemical reaction. Stoichiometry involves using molar ratios to calculate the amounts of products and reactants in chemical reactions.

### 4.6 Limiting Reagents and Percent Yield
-------------------------------------------

#### 4.6.1 Limiting Reagents

A limiting reagent is the reactant that is completely consumed in a chemical reaction, limiting the amount of product that can be formed. Identifying the limiting reagent is critical in stoichiometry, as it allows us to determine the maximum amount of product that can be formed.

#### 4.6.2 Percent Yield

Percent yield is a measure of the efficiency of a chemical reaction. It's calculated by dividing the actual yield of a product by the theoretical yield and multiplying by 100.
