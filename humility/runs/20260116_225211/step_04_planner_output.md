'Section 4: Stoichiometry and Chemical Reactions\\
\\
This section will introduce the reader to the quantitative aspects of chemistry, focusing on stoichiometry and chemical reactions. It will cover the laws of conservation of mass and definite proportions, as well as the mole concept and Avogadro's number. The reader will learn how to balance chemical equations, calculate molar ratios, and predict the amounts of products and reactants in chemical reactions. Additionally, it will introduce the reader to the concept of limiting reagents and percent yield, and explain how these concepts are used to solve problems in chemistry.'
