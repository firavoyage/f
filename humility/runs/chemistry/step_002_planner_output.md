**Section 2: Atomic Structure**

**2.1 Introduction to Atomic Structure**

The study of atomic structure is a fundamental aspect of chemistry. Atoms are the building blocks of matter, and understanding their structure is essential for understanding the properties and behavior of elements and compounds.

**2.2 Atomic Models**

Historically, several atomic models have been proposed to describe the structure of atoms. These models include:

* The Rutherford model: proposed by Ernest Rutherford, this model describes the atom as a small, dense nucleus surrounded by electrons.
* The Bohr model: proposed by Niels Bohr, this model describes the atom as a small, dense nucleus surrounded by electrons in specific energy levels or shells.
* The modern atomic model: this model describes the atom as a small, dense nucleus surrounded by electrons in specific energy levels or shells, with the addition of quantum mechanics and wave-particle duality.

**2.3 Electron Configuration**

Electron configuration is a way of describing the arrangement of electrons in an atom. It is based on the energy levels or shells of the atom and can be used to predict the properties of elements and compounds.

**2.4 Atomic Number and Mass Number**

The atomic number (Z) is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, while the mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Understanding the relationship between atomic number and mass number is essential for understanding the properties of elements and compounds.

**2.5 Periodic Table**

The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of elements based on their atomic number and recurring chemical properties. It is a powerful tool for predicting the properties of elements and compounds and understanding the relationships between them.
