# 1

writing markdown, when would you like to use quotation marks or backticks

---

That’s a good, practical question, Fira.
Let’s slow it down and keep it simple.

In Markdown, **quotation marks** and **backticks** serve very different purposes.

---

### Quotation marks `" "`

Use quotation marks when you are writing **normal language**.

They’re for:

- Quoting what someone said
- Referring to a word or phrase as a concept
- Writing naturally, the way you would in an essay or message

Example:

> She said, “This feels clearer now.”

Or:

> The word “mindfulness” is often misunderstood.

Quotation marks are about **meaning and speech**, not formatting.

---

### Backticks `` ` ``

Use backticks when you are pointing to **code, commands, or literal text** that should not be interpreted.

They’re for:

- Code snippets
- File names
- Commands
- Variables
- Exact text you want shown as-is

Example:

```
Use the `git commit` command.
```

Or:

```
The config file is named `settings.json`.
```

Backticks tell the reader:

> “Treat this as literal, technical text.”

---

### A gentle rule of thumb

If you’re **talking about language**, use quotation marks.
If you’re **talking about code or exact text**, use backticks.

Or even simpler:

- **Human speech → quotation marks**
- **Machine-readable text → backticks**

---

If you’d like, we can walk through a real sentence you’re writing and decide together which one fits best.

# 2

what does each feel

---

Ah. That’s a subtle question, Fira — and a wise one.
Let’s talk about _feel_, not rules.

---

### Quotation marks feel like **voice**

They feel human.

When you use quotation marks, it feels like:

- Someone is speaking
- A thought is being held gently
- The word has emotion, tone, or intention

They invite the reader to _listen_.

Example:

> The word “home” carries warmth.

That feels soft. Interpretive. Alive.
The reader senses meaning beyond the letters.

---

### Backticks feel like **object**

They feel precise and still.

When you use backticks, it feels like:

- You’re placing something on a table to examine
- The text is fixed, exact, untouchable
- Emotion is paused in favor of clarity

Example:

> The function is named `home()`.

That feels clean. Technical. Neutral.
The reader is not meant to interpret — only to recognize.

---

### The deeper contrast

Quotation marks say:

> _“This is a word as we experience it.”_

Backticks say:

> _“This is a thing as it exists.”_

One is **felt**.
The other is **handled**.

---

### How it lands in the body

- Quotation marks → a small inward lean, like listening
- Backticks → a slight step back, like observing

Neither is better.
They just invite different kinds of attention.

---

If you want, tell me what you’re writing — something reflective, technical, or in between — and we can tune the feel together.

# 3

what do you think of using backticks for youtube vids title. btw it supports weird characters.

---

That’s a thoughtful instinct, Fira.
Let’s sit with how it _lands_.

Using backticks for a YouTube video title makes the title feel like an **object**, not a voice.

```
I recommend `How I Quit My Job & Found Peace ✨🔥`
```

This tells the reader:
_This is the exact title, copied as-is._
No interpretation. No smoothing. Even the “weird” characters are part of the thing.

That can be very appropriate when:

- You want precision
- The title is long, stylized, or chaotic
- You’re pointing to it almost like a filename or reference
- You don’t want the punctuation or emojis to be “cleaned up” by the reader’s mind

Backticks quietly say:

> “Don’t paraphrase this. Look at it.”

---

Quotation marks feel different:

> I recommend “How I Quit My Job & Found Peace ✨🔥”

This feels more conversational.
It invites the reader to _hear_ the title, not inspect it.
The emojis feel expressive rather than literal.

---

### So the choice becomes intentional

- **Backticks** → archival, exact, reference-like
- **Quotation marks** → conversational, expressive, human

For YouTube titles specifically, I’d say:

- In **technical notes, lists, or recommendations** → backticks feel clean
- In **essays, reflections, or storytelling** → quotation marks feel warmer

Neither is wrong.
Backticks just carry a cooler, more deliberate tone.

---

A quiet guideline you might like:
If you’d be slightly annoyed by someone misquoting the title, use backticks.
If you’re happy for it to live as an idea, use quotation marks.

If you want, share a real sentence you’re drafting, and we’ll feel it together.
