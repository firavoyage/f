grok does not support epub. recommend other llms.

---

Sorry to hear Grok doesn't support EPUB uploads—it's a limitation we're working on improving. In the meantime, here are some excellent alternative LLMs that fully support EPUB file uploads for analysis, summarization, Q&A, translation, and more. I've focused on reliable, user-friendly options (both free and paid tiers available), based on their current capabilities as of December 2025.

### Top Recommendations:

1. **Claude (by Anthropic)**

   - **Why it's great for EPUB**: Direct upload of EPUB files (up to 100 pages for visual analysis, unlimited text extraction). It excels at deep analysis, chapter breakdowns, summaries, and creative tasks like rewriting or discussing themes. Handles formatting well without losing structure.
   - **Access**: Free tier (limited uploads); Pro ($20/month) for unlimited. Available on claude.ai or apps.
   - **Best for**: In-depth book discussions or academic analysis.
   - **How to use**: Upload your EPUB in a new chat, then ask questions like "Summarize Chapter 3" or "What themes recur in this book?"

2. **ChatGPT (by OpenAI)**

   - **Why it's great for EPUB**: Supports EPUB uploads in the Plus tier. You can analyze entire books, generate summaries, answer queries, or even translate chapters. Convert EPUB to text/DOCX first if needed (via free tools like Calibre).
   - **Access**: Free for basic text input; Plus ($20/month) for file uploads. On chatgpt.com or apps.
   - **Best for**: Quick summaries, creative writing extensions, or casual Q&A.
   - **Tip**: For free workarounds, extract text from EPUB using Calibre and paste it in—ChatGPT handles large texts well.

3. **Gemini (by Google)**

   - **Why it's great for EPUB**: Upload EPUB directly for analysis, including image extraction from illustrated books. Great for multimodal tasks (e.g., discussing book covers or diagrams) and integrates with Google Drive for easy access.
   - **Access**: Free tier (limited); Advanced ($20/month) for more uploads. On gemini.google.com.
   - **Best for**: Visual books or research with integrated search.

4. **Microsoft Copilot**
   - **Why it's great for EPUB**: Supports EPUB uploads in Copilot Pro, with strong integration for Office apps (e.g., export analysis to Word). Excellent for professional summaries, data extraction, or business book reviews.
   - **Access**: Free basic version; Pro ($20/month) for uploads. On copilot.microsoft.com or Bing.
   - **Best for**: Productivity-focused users.

### Quick Comparison Table:

| LLM         | EPUB Upload Support | Free Tier Limits | Paid Tier Cost | Strengths for EPUB Analysis            | Weaknesses                |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Claude**  | Yes (direct)        | 5-10 uploads/mo  | $20/mo         | Deep reasoning, low hallucinations     | Slower on very long books |
| **ChatGPT** | Yes (Plus only)     | Text only        | $20/mo         | Versatile, fast responses              | May need file conversion  |
| **Gemini**  | Yes (direct)        | Limited uploads  | $20/mo         | Multimodal (images/videos in books)    | Less creative than Claude |
| **Copilot** | Yes (Pro only)      | Text only        | $20/mo         | Office integration, professional tools | More business-oriented    |

### Bonus Free Workarounds (No Paid Subscription Needed):

- **BundleIQ Alani**: Free tool to convert EPUB to a chat-ready format, then feed into free ChatGPT or Perplexity AI for analysis.
- **Local Tools**: Use Calibre (free EPUB manager) to extract text, then paste into free LLMs like Grok (text-only) or open-source options like Llama 3 via Hugging Face.
- **Perplexity AI**: Free tier supports PDF uploads—convert EPUB to PDF first (using Calibre). Great for quick searches within books.

If you share more about what you're analyzing (e.g., fiction for summaries or non-fiction for insights), I can suggest tailored prompts or more specific alternatives. Or, if you'd like me to help convert/extract text from your EPUB right now (paste a sample chapter!), just let me know! 🚀
