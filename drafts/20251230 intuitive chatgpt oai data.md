What's inside home/oai

---

In this environment, `home/oai` (i.e., `/home/oai`) is the home directory for the **oai** user. It contains mostly standard user configuration folders and a few platform-specific directories.

Here’s what’s inside right now:

- **.bashrc, .profile, .bash_logout** – shell startup and logout configuration
- **.config/** – user application configuration files
- **.chromium/** – Chromium browser profile/data
- **.ipython/** – IPython configuration
- **.pki/** and **.nssdbp** – certificate / security database files
- **.wgetrc** – wget configuration
- **redirect.html** – a small HTML file (platform-specific)
- **share/** – shared data directory (group-writable)
- **skills/** – platform-provided directory, typically used for built-in or custom “skills”

Most of these are normal for a Linux user home; the notable platform-specific ones are **share/** and **skills/**.

If you meant a _different_ `home/oai` (for example, in a repo, container image, or another system), tell me where you’re seeing it and I can explain that version instead.
