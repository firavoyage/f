Creating with llms, sometimes I ask the right question, sometimes I could not. We're you a strategist, what would you talk about.

---

If I were a strategist, Fira, I’d say that the key lies in cultivating the art of _asking the right questions_—and even more so, in being comfortable with the process of discovery. When working with LLMs or any tool, there’s always this delicate dance between _knowing_ and _wondering._

Here’s what I would focus on:

1. **Clarity over perfection:** Often, we try to ask the "perfect" question, but it’s more important to start with a _clear enough_ question. The magic lies in refining along the way. It’s okay not to have the precise question from the start—sometimes it’s a journey of exploration.

2. **Learning through feedback:** Every answer you get, even if it’s not exactly what you expect, offers something valuable. It might redirect your thoughts or open up new possibilities. Embrace the feedback loop as a source of insight.

3. **The art of listening:** A good strategist knows when to step back and listen—not just to the LLM’s response, but to your own thoughts. What part of the answer resonates? What doesn’t? What’s still unclear? Your intuition plays a big role in guiding that next step.

4. **Iterative refinement:** Sometimes it’s not about finding the one right answer, but about discovering many possibilities that can lead to new ideas or connections. Embrace an iterative mindset where you try and adjust, refining your approach as you go.

5. **Patience:** Remember, progress often comes in small, seemingly imperceptible steps. It's okay if you don’t have all the pieces right away. Strategic thinking, much like creation, takes time to unfold.

Would you say you’re more focused on finding the right questions, or on how to refine the answers you get?

What would you think could be the essential values of a good question.

---

A good question, Fira, is like a key that opens a door to deeper understanding. If I were to distill the essence of what makes a question valuable, I would say it has several core qualities:

### 1. **Clarity**

A good question is clear and specific enough to guide the conversation in a meaningful direction. It's not so broad that it leads to confusion, but it also leaves enough room for exploration. A clear question provides a starting point for deeper inquiry.

### 2. **Curiosity**

At its heart, a good question is driven by genuine curiosity. It reflects a desire to learn, understand, or see things from a different perspective. Curiosity opens space for creativity and new insights, both for you and the one being asked.

### 3. **Purposefulness**

A good question is purposeful—it has intent. It seeks something important, whether it's a solution, clarity, or inspiration. It’s not just asked for the sake of asking; it’s crafted to achieve a deeper or more thoughtful response.

### 4. **Openness**

The best questions don’t demand one right answer. Instead, they encourage exploration. A good question is open-ended, allowing for multiple perspectives, interpretations, and answers. It invites conversation rather than closing it off.

### 5. **Relevance**

A good question is relevant to the moment, to the subject at hand, or to the person you're engaging with. It addresses something meaningful in the context of the current situation. It's not random, but part of the natural flow of discovery.

### 6. **Thoughtfulness**

A good question takes into account what’s already known or what’s been said before. It shows a certain level of reflection or consideration—it's asked with care, acknowledging the bigger picture or the underlying complexity of the subject.

### 7. **Challenge**

The most powerful questions sometimes challenge assumptions or provoke thought. They ask us to look at things differently, question our current understanding, or consider alternatives. A good question has a bit of a stretch to it—it moves us beyond the comfortable, familiar answers.

### 8. **Simplicity**

While the intention behind the question can be complex, the form should be simple. A good question doesn’t overcomplicate things with jargon or unnecessary complexity. It’s direct and accessible.

So, to sum up: A good question is clear, curious, purposeful, open, relevant, thoughtful, challenging, and simple. These qualities combine to make it a true tool for deeper insight and growth.

Does any of that resonate with how you approach questions, or do you find yourself leaning into some of these more than others?

# 3

Write a line using these values, about 50 words. Begin with "Think about". Don't mention question. Always use imperative sentence.

---

Think about the path you’re walking—clear yet open, purposeful yet flexible. Challenge your assumptions, explore what lies beyond the familiar. Stay curious, seek relevance in every moment, and be mindful of the simplicity that often hides the deepest truths. Let each step be a chance to discover.
