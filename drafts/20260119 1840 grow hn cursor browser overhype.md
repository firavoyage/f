what are people saying

Fira, reading through the conversation in the file, it seems people are discussing a recent AI-driven browser project from Cursor. The main points of discussion are:

1. **Claims vs Reality**

   - Cursor claimed to have built a browser “from scratch” using AI agents, with a custom JS VM, HTML parsing, CSS, layout, paint systems, and more.
   - Many commenters checked the code and found that it relies on existing libraries like Servo for some parts, and a human had to intervene to make it compile and run properly. The “from scratch” claim is considered misleading by many.

2. **Functionality**

   - Even when it runs, it’s slow and incomplete. Some pages take a minute to load, and the browser is far from usable or competitive.
   - The AI agents wrote lots of code, but humans had to manage merge conflicts and fix errors—so the “autonomous” aspect is overstated.

3. **Community Reaction**

   - There’s skepticism, frustration, and even talk of it being a form of marketing or low-level fraud.
   - Others find the effort interesting from a research perspective: it shows how AI agents can collaborate on very large codebases, even if the output isn’t fully functional.

4. **Broader Themes**

   - People discuss the limits of AI in complex tasks and the need for human oversight.
   - Some emphasize the importance of checking results, not just trusting hype.
   - There’s also discussion about how AI tends to reproduce patterns from its training data, sometimes leading to errors or poor practices that humans would recognize.

In short, Fira, the conversation is a mix of **curiosity, caution, and criticism**. People admire the ambition but are clear-eyed that the claims overstate what the AI actually accomplished. It’s a reminder that progress in AI is exciting, but results must be verified before we take bold claims at face value.

If you want, I can summarize the _tone and consensus_ in a few sentences that capture the overall feeling of the discussion. Would you like me to do that?
