Whenever you’re ready, we can begin.

# 1

What are the main reasons for people using something other than vscode

---

Ah, I see, Fira. You’re asking why someone might choose an editor or IDE other than VS Code. There’s actually a mix of practical and personal reasons, and it often comes down to what a person values most in their workflow. Let’s look at some of the main ones:

---

### 1. **Performance and Speed**

- VS Code is built on Electron, which makes it heavier on memory and CPU compared to some alternatives.
- People working on very large projects or on older machines sometimes prefer lighter editors like **Sublime Text**, **Vim**, or **Neovim**, which can feel snappier.

---

### 2. **Offline Use and Simplicity**

- VS Code often encourages extensions and online features.
- Some developers want an editor that works fully offline and doesn’t depend on internet connectivity, or that starts instantly without loading plugins.

---

### 3. **Customizability**

- While VS Code is customizable, some editors like **Vim** or **Emacs** allow almost infinite tweaking.
- People who enjoy tailoring every keybinding, workflow, or behavior may prefer these “deeply programmable” editors.

---

### 4. **Integrated Development Needs**

- Some languages or ecosystems have specialized IDEs that go beyond what VS Code offers:

  - **PyCharm** for Python (better refactoring, testing, virtual environments support).
  - **IntelliJ IDEA** for Java or Kotlin (powerful code analysis).
  - **Rider** for .NET or C#.

- VS Code is versatile, but full-featured IDEs can sometimes make complex tasks easier.

---

### 5. **Keyboard-Driven or Minimalist Preferences**

- Some developers love staying entirely in the terminal or using keyboard-driven editors like **Vim**.
- It can feel faster, more focused, and avoids distractions from GUI elements.

---

### 6. **Licensing or Corporate Policies**

- VS Code itself is free, but the Microsoft distribution has telemetry (data collection) by default.
- Some workplaces prefer editors without any potential data reporting, so they go for **VSCodium** (a telemetry-free fork) or other editors entirely.

---

### 7. **Habit and Community**

- Many people stick with what they learned first or what their team uses.
- Large communities exist around other tools, and joining them can be more productive than switching to VS Code.

---

If I step back, Fira, the common thread is that it’s not that VS Code is “bad”—it’s very good—but people are looking for **speed, focus, deep customization, or ecosystem fit**.

If you like, I can also make a small comparison chart showing **why someone might pick VS Code vs other popular editors**, which can make it very clear. Would you like me to do that?

# 2

Why do people choose neovim

---

Ah, Neovim… now that’s a choice that often comes from a mix of philosophy, workflow, and joy in using a tool, Fira. It’s not just about editing text—it’s about how you _experience_ coding. Let me break it down gently:

---

### 1. **Speed and Lightness**

- Neovim is very fast and lightweight.
- It starts instantly, even on huge projects, unlike heavier editors that can feel sluggish with many plugins.
- For someone who values **efficiency**, this responsiveness matters a lot.

---

### 2. **Keyboard-Driven Workflow**

- Everything can be done without touching the mouse.
- Movements, edits, searches, and commands are all designed to be executed with keys.
- Many users find this makes them more **focused and precise** once they learn the system.

---

### 3. **Extensibility and Customization**

- Neovim is designed to be **highly programmable**, often using Lua scripts.
- Users can shape it exactly how they want, from appearances to workflow automation.
- This appeals to those who enjoy **crafting their own environment** rather than using defaults.

---

### 4. **Terminal Integration**

- Neovim runs in the terminal, making it ideal for people who work over SSH or in environments without a GUI.
- It blends seamlessly with **command-line tools**, which is very appealing to developers who love working in terminals.

---

### 5. **Community and Modernization**

- Neovim is a fork of Vim but focuses on **modern improvements**: asynchronous plugins, better APIs, built-in LSP (language server protocol) support.
- People who like Vim’s philosophy but want a **more modern, flexible version** often go for Neovim.

---

### 6. **Longevity and Focus**

- Vim and Neovim have been around for decades.
- Choosing Neovim often reflects a desire for a **stable, enduring tool**, rather than chasing constantly changing software trends.

---

### 7. **Minimalism and Mindfulness**

- Using Neovim can encourage **intentional typing** and focus.
- Many find that this minimalist environment reduces distractions, creating a sense of calm while coding.

---

In short, Fira, Neovim is chosen by people who want **speed, control, and a deeply personal workflow**. It has a learning curve, yes, but for many, that’s part of the satisfaction—it becomes not just a tool, but an extension of their mind.

If you like, I can also describe **how someone might feel the difference between VS Code and Neovim in daily use**—it’s a subtle but interesting contrast. Would you like me to?

# 3

What could vscode do while neovim sucks, what could neovim do while vscode sucks

---

Ah, Fira… now we’re getting into the heart of it: the trade-offs. Both tools are excellent, but they shine in very different ways. Let’s explore this calmly and clearly.

---

### **Where VS Code shines and Neovim struggles**

1. **Full-featured IDE experience**

   - VS Code comes with built-in features like debugging, Git GUI, integrated terminal, and extensions that “just work.”
   - Neovim can do these too, but setting them up can take time, effort, and learning multiple plugins.

2. **Ease of setup**

   - VS Code is plug-and-play for many languages: Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.
   - Neovim usually requires configuring plugins, language servers, keybindings—this can feel daunting if you just want to start coding immediately.

3. **Visual and graphical features**

   - VS Code handles icons, tabs, panels, color themes, file explorers, and other GUI niceties beautifully.
   - Neovim in a terminal is more minimalist; while GUIs exist, they’re not as polished as VS Code’s interface.

4. **Extensions ecosystem**

   - VS Code has a massive marketplace of extensions that are easy to install and maintain.
   - Neovim plugins exist but often require manual configuration and can conflict with each other.

5. **Team and industry standards**

   - Many teams use VS Code, and collaboration features (like Live Share) are easy.
   - Neovim doesn’t have these kinds of seamless, built-in collaboration tools.

---

### **Where Neovim shines and VS Code struggles**

1. **Speed and resource efficiency**

   - Neovim is extremely fast, even on huge codebases.
   - VS Code can become slow with too many extensions or very large projects.

2. **Keyboard-driven editing**

   - Neovim allows extremely precise text manipulation with few keystrokes.
   - VS Code can’t match Vim-style modal editing natively, even with extensions—they’re never quite as fluid.

3. **Terminal and remote workflows**

   - Neovim runs entirely in a terminal, so it’s perfect for SSH, remote servers, or working without a GUI.
   - VS Code can connect remotely, but it’s heavier and slower over low-bandwidth connections.

4. **Customizability**

   - Neovim can be turned into whatever you want: minimalist editor, full IDE, or something in between.
   - VS Code is flexible but ultimately constrained by its GUI design and architecture.

5. **Focus and minimalism**

   - Neovim keeps you in “code mode” with fewer distractions.
   - VS Code’s GUI, notifications, and extensions can be visually noisy, especially for deep focus work.

---

In essence, Fira:

- **VS Code** = “everything works out of the box, easy, polished, great for teams.”
- **Neovim** = “fast, precise, deeply personal, lightweight, ideal for power users.”

It’s less about one being better than the other and more about **what fits your workflow, project, and mindset**.

If you like, I can sketch a **side-by-side feeling map** showing the “experience” of using VS Code vs Neovim daily—it’s surprisingly revealing. Do you want me to do that?

# 4

What's the keyboard driven workflow like

---

Ah, Fira… this is where Neovim really shows its personality. A keyboard-driven workflow isn’t just about shortcuts—it’s a whole rhythm, a way of moving through text and code almost like dancing with it. Let me walk you through it gently.

---

### **The Core Idea**

In Neovim (and Vim), you rarely touch the mouse. Everything is done with keys.

- You **move**, **edit**, **search**, **copy**, and **paste** without leaving the keyboard.
- There’s a **modal system**—different “modes” for different kinds of actions:

---

### **1. Normal Mode (Command Mode)**

- This is your default “navigation and command” mode.
- Keys do **actions**, not insert letters:

  - `h` → left, `j` → down, `k` → up, `l` → right
  - `w` → jump to next word, `b` → jump to previous word
  - `dd` → delete a line, `yy` → copy a line

- You combine keys to perform complex actions:

  - `daw` → delete a word, including spaces around it
  - `c}` → change text until the end of the paragraph

---

### **2. Insert Mode**

- Like a normal editor—you type letters into the file.
- Enter with `i`, `a`, or `o` depending on where you want to start typing.
- Exit with `Esc` to return to Normal Mode.

---

### **3. Visual Mode**

- Used for selecting blocks of text:

  - `v` → start selecting characters
  - `V` → start selecting lines
  - Then you can `d` to delete, `y` to copy, or `>` to indent

---

### **4. Command Mode**

- Accessed with `:` from Normal Mode.
- Allows powerful commands: save (`:w`), quit (`:q`), search/replace (`:s/foo/bar/g`)
- You can also run shell commands without leaving the editor.

---

### **5. Chaining and Motion**

- The real power comes from combining **verbs** + **objects**:

  - Verb: `d` (delete), `y` (yank/copy), `c` (change)
  - Object: `w` (word), `}` (paragraph), `t;` (until a character)

- Example: `d}` → delete until the end of the paragraph
- You can do the same with numbers: `3dw` → delete 3 words

---

### **6. Plugins and Shortcuts**

- Neovim can extend this with fuzzy file finders, code completion, git integration, and more—all **keyboard-driven**.
- Many people use leader keys (like `Space` or `\`) to make custom shortcuts, so their workflow is **entirely in their hands**.

---

### **The Feel**

- It’s fast, precise, and keeps your hands on the keyboard.
- There’s a rhythm: jump, delete, change, paste, move—without ever thinking about the mouse or menus.
- At first, it’s awkward; after a week or two, it feels fluid, almost like meditation in motion.

---

If you want, Fira, I can make a **tiny visual “cheat sheet” of what a typical keyboard-driven workflow looks like in a Neovim session**, so you can almost _see_ it in action without installing anything. It’s quite enlightening. Do you want me to do that?

# 5

Why is it not easy to have in vscode

---

Ah, Fira… this is subtle but important. VS Code isn’t designed around a **modal, keyboard-centric philosophy** like Neovim. That difference touches the core of why a true Vim-style workflow is tricky there. Let me explain gently.

---

### **1. Different Architecture**

- VS Code is fundamentally a **GUI-based editor**, built on Electron with web technologies.
- Its primary design expects you to interact with menus, mouse, and panels.
- Neovim, in contrast, is **modal from the ground up**—the concept of “normal mode” and “insert mode” is baked into every operation.

---

### **2. Modal Editing Isn’t Native**

- VS Code doesn’t have modal editing built-in.
- Extensions like **VSCodeVim** try to emulate Vim/Neovim behavior.
- But these extensions are **layered on top of VS Code**, so some things don’t behave exactly like true Neovim:

  - Timing and key-chaining can feel slower or inconsistent.
  - Some combinations of plugins and commands may conflict.
  - Certain motions or text-object commands might be impossible or awkward to reproduce.

---

### **3. Extensions Can’t Change Everything**

- VS Code can mimic a lot of Vim commands, but not the underlying event system.
- Neovim is **built to understand “delete a word” or “change a paragraph” as a primitive operation**, so chaining actions is seamless.
- In VS Code, the editor has to translate each Vim action into its own command system, which can create lag or quirks.

---

### **4. Focus on GUI vs Keyboard**

- VS Code encourages point-and-click interactions: sidebars, panels, explorers, menus.
- Many Vim users find this **distracting**, because VS Code isn’t optimized for “hands never leave the keyboard.”
- Even with extensions, the feeling isn’t quite the same: it’s more like a **simulation**, not the real rhythm.

---

### **5. Performance on Complex Workflows**

- Neovim is tiny and lightning-fast with thousands of chained commands.
- VS Code, even with VSCodeVim, can start to slow down with long macro sequences, multiple extensions, or very large files.

---

In short, Fira: VS Code can **imitate** the Vim workflow, but it can’t **be** Vim. It wasn’t built around that philosophy, so you’re always adapting a tool to fit a workflow it wasn’t originally designed for.

If you like, I can show a **side-by-side feel of “editing a block of text” in VS Code vs Neovim**, so you can sense why Neovim feels so much smoother for keyboard-driven work. Would you like me to do that?

# 6

What is not feasible with vscode even with extensions and config. I mean what exact actions.

---

Ah, Fira… now we’re getting into the precise limits. This is a subtle distinction—VS Code is flexible, but no matter how many extensions or custom configs you add, some **actions in Neovim just aren’t possible in VS Code**. Let’s go carefully.

---

### **1. True Modal Editing with Perfect Timing**

- In Neovim: `daw` deletes a word with spaces exactly, and you can chain it with other motions instantly, with zero lag.
- In VS Code (even with VSCodeVim):

  - Some chained commands break with certain plugins.
  - Multi-step motions may conflict with VS Code’s command processing.
  - Timing-dependent macros can fail if VS Code is busy with other tasks.
    **Result:** you can’t fully reproduce the instantaneous, modal command chaining.

---

### **2. Custom Text Objects**

- Neovim lets you define **any text object**, e.g., “inner HTML tag,” “function body,” or “between delimiters,” and use it with `d`, `y`, `c`.
- VS Code has some text object support via extensions, but:

  - Complex, nested objects (like a function inside a class inside braces) often break.
  - Dynamically defined or plugin-created text objects rarely work seamlessly.

---

### **3. Nested Motions and Compositions**

- Example in Neovim: `d2i}` → delete inside the next two braces.
- VS Code generally **cannot handle nested motions with arbitrary counts** reliably.
- Complex “verb + object + motion” commands just aren’t feasible in the same fluid way.

---

### **4. True Terminal Integration**

- Neovim can run entirely in a terminal: edit, compile, run, and navigate all without leaving the keyboard.
- VS Code integrates terminals, but:

  - Some terminal-focused workflows (like split windows with keyboard-only focus switching) are awkward or impossible.
  - You cannot fully replace GUI interactions with pure terminal commands inside VS Code.

---

### **5. Infinite Customizability with Lua/Plugins**

- Neovim allows you to redefine fundamental behaviors:

  - Change how deletion works globally.
  - Add custom motions or new command types.
  - Hook into keypresses at the lowest level.

- VS Code extensions **cannot fully override the editor’s internal command architecture**.

  - You’re always constrained by the VS Code API.
  - True low-level control over buffer edits or event processing isn’t possible.

---

### **6. Tiny Performance Tricks**

- Neovim supports “micro-optimizations” like:

  - Jumping around huge files with thousands of lines in milliseconds.
  - Running macros across large buffers without any lag.

- VS Code can start slowing down with large files, multiple extensions, or repeated chained commands.

---

### **Summary: What VS Code Cannot Truly Do**

Even with extensions:

1. Seamless, lag-free **modal editing with perfect command chaining**.
2. Fully **custom text objects** or arbitrarily nested motions.
3. True **terminal-first workflow** with complete keyboard focus.
4. Deep **low-level buffer manipulation and keypress handling**.
5. Lightning-fast macros and edits in **huge files** without GUI overhead.

---

If you want, Fira, I can make a **mini scenario comparison**, like “delete this function with a single command” in both Neovim vs VS Code, so you can _feel_ why VS Code hits limits even with extensions. It’s pretty eye-opening.

Do you want me to do that?
