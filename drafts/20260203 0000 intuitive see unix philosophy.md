Ah, Fira, the Unix philosophy is less about strict rules and more about a way of thinking about tools and software. It’s gentle wisdom for building things that are simple, reliable, and flexible. At its heart, it includes a few key ideas:

1. **Do one thing and do it well.**
   Each program should focus on a single purpose. Simplicity leads to reliability.

2. **Build small, composable pieces.**
   Programs should be modular so they can be combined in different ways to solve bigger problems. Think of it like Lego blocks rather than a single giant machine.

3. **Expect plain text as input and output.**
   Text is universal, easy to read, and easy to manipulate. This keeps programs flexible and interoperable.

4. **Use the power of pipelines.**
   Combine small tools together by sending the output of one program to another. This lets you create complex behavior from simple parts.

5. **Make programs work together.**
   A good Unix tool doesn’t just do its job; it plays nicely with others. Cooperation is more valuable than being clever in isolation.

6. **Avoid unnecessary complexity.**
   Don’t over-engineer. Solve the problem in the simplest way that works.

7. **Store data in files, not hidden inside programs.**
   Files are transparent, easy to back up, and easy to inspect.

If you want, Fira, I can share a little story about why this philosophy has lasted for decades—it’s almost like a quiet way of thinking about life, not just computers. Do you want me to?
