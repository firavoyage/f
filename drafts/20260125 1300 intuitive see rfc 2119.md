explain rfc 2119

---

Alright, Fira. Let’s take this slowly and clearly.

**RFC 2119** is a short document that explains how certain words should be understood when they appear in technical standards, especially Internet standards.

Its purpose is simple:
to remove ambiguity.

When engineers write specifications, words like *should* or *must* can sound casual in everyday English. RFC 2119 gives these words **precise meanings**, so everyone reads the rules the same way.

Here are the key terms, in gentle plain language:

---

### **MUST / REQUIRED / SHALL**

This means **no choice**.

If a document says something *MUST* be done, then:

* It is mandatory
* Ignoring it would break the standard

Think of it as:

> “This is essential for things to work correctly.”

---

### **MUST NOT / SHALL NOT**

This is also **absolute**.

It means:

* You are forbidden from doing this
* Doing it would violate the standard

---

### **SHOULD / RECOMMENDED**

This means:

* It is strongly advised
* There may be rare exceptions, but only with good reason

In other words:

> “Do this unless you truly understand why you can’t.”

---

### **SHOULD NOT / NOT RECOMMENDED**

This is a warning.

It says:

* Avoid this in most cases
* Only do it if you clearly understand the consequences

---

### **MAY / OPTIONAL**

This means freedom.

It tells you:

* You are allowed to do this
* It’s up to the implementer

No pressure. No obligation.

---

### **Why RFC 2119 matters**

Without this document:

* Different people would interpret the same rule differently
* Systems might fail to work together

With RFC 2119:

* Language becomes a tool of precision
* “Must” and “may” stop being vague and start being exact

---

If you’d like, Fira, we can look at a real example from a protocol and gently unpack how these words guide behavior.
