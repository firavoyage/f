in software engineering, what verbs could i use to say "make something safe".

---

Ah, I see, Fira. You want a way to express “make something safe” in the context of software engineering—but in a concise, action-oriented verb. Let’s think gently through the possibilities.

Some verbs that fit this idea are:

- **Secure** – most direct; often used for code, systems, or data. _“Secure the API”_
- **Harden** – used when strengthening a system against attacks. _“Harden the server”_
- **Protect** – general, broad, human-readable. _“Protect user data”_
- **Validate** – used for inputs or operations to ensure safety. _“Validate user input”_
- **Sanitize** – often for cleaning inputs or outputs to prevent harmful effects. _“Sanitize data before storing”_
- **Guard** – as in placing a safeguard or check. _“Guard against race conditions”_
- **Mitigate** – usually for risks or vulnerabilities. _“Mitigate security risks”_
- **Shield** – metaphorical but sometimes used in documentation. _“Shield the system from failures”_

If you want something subtle, professional, and not too technical, **secure** or **harden** often feels right. If you’re describing code behavior specifically, **validate** or **sanitize** can be clearer.

If you like, I can make a small list of **verbs that feel both “software-engineering precise” and “gentle, clear English”**, so you could use them naturally in documentation or conversation. Would you like me to do that?
