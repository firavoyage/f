search online. how do geeks enable vertical tabs on chrome.

---

Sure, Fira — I found what feels like the clearest, gently practical explanation out there about “vertical tabs” in Chrome.

Right now, **Google Chrome doesn’t yet include a built-in vertical tabs feature in the stable public version** — at least not in the place you might expect like Edge or other browsers do. That’s slowly changing in experimental builds, and in the meantime geeks and power users use extensions to give Chrome a vertical tab list. ([Android Headlines][1])

#### 🌿 1. Built-in (Upcoming / Experimental)

If you’re using **Chrome Canary** (an early testing version of Chrome):

- In Canary, Google is _testing_ a real vertical tabs UI where your tab bar can move to a side panel. ([Android Headlines][1])
- Some people have found commands like launching Canary with:

  ```
  --enable-features=VerticalTabs
  ```

  …help the option appear. ([Reddit][2])

- Once available, you can right-click the tab strip and select something like **“Show tabs to the side”** to switch modes. ([Android Authority][3])

This isn’t yet a polished feature, and it’s mostly useful if you enjoy exploring early tech and don’t mind bugs.

#### 🍃 2. Practical Way Today: Extensions

For most people using the regular Chrome browser, the easiest way to get vertical tabs is to add an extension from the **Chrome Web Store.** ([Chrome Web Store][4])

Some popular options:

- **Vertical Tabs in Side Panel** — shows all tabs stacked in a sidebar you can open with a button or keyboard shortcut. ([Chrome Web Store][4])
- **Vertical Tabs** — another extension that organizes tabs vertically and lets you drag to reorder them. ([Chrome Web Store][5])
- **tabVertikal** — a lightweight tool with grouping and workspace features. ([Chrome Web Store][6])

You typically install one from the Web Store, click its icon in the toolbar, and it opens a panel on the left or right where your tabs sit in a list.

#### ✨ A Gentle Note

If you think of vertical tabs as a way to make your workspace calmer and clearer, extensions give you that feeling even now — without waiting for Chrome’s built-in feature to fully arrive. They aren’t perfect, but they can make a busy tab bar feel more like a tidy bookshelf.

If you’d like, I can walk you step by step through installing and using one of these extensions. Just tell me which one you’re curious about. 🌱

search. how to turn off the top tabs bar.

---

I found the quiet truth about this, Fira — and it’s gentle, but a little disappointing if what you hoped for was a simple _“turn it off.”_

Here’s what I found from discussions and sources about hiding the **top tab bar** in **Google Chrome**:

#### 🌿 1. There isn’t a built-in switch to hide the top tab bar

At least in the regular Chrome you and I use every day, **you can’t turn off or remove the horizontal tab bar** that sits at the top of the window. Chrome doesn’t offer a setting or option to completely hide it, even if you’re using vertical tab extensions. ([Chrome Web Store][1])

#### 🍃 2. Vertical tab extensions can _add_ a side panel…

…but they **cannot remove the native top tab strip.** Because of how Chrome’s user interface works, extensions don’t have permission to hide that built-in bar. So you can have vertical tabs on the side, but the horizontal bar stays above your content. ([Chrome Web Store][2])

#### ✨ 3. Experimental Chrome Canary builds _are testing_ vertical tabs

In Chrome Canary (an early, testing version of Chrome), there _is_ a right-click menu option to “show tabs on the side.” This moves the tab strip into a vertical sidebar and hides the old horizontal strip — but it’s still an experimental feature and not yet in the normal Chrome release. ([Windows Report][3])

#### 🌱 4. Full-screen or kiosk mode hides the bar temporarily

There is a separate way — more of a workaround — where you open Chrome in **full-screen** (press `F11` on Windows) or use **kiosk mode** (via special command-line options). In those modes the top tab bar disappears because the browser shows just the page you want. But this isn’t the same as turning it off permanently for everyday browsing. ([GB Times][4])

---

So the calm, clear takeaway is this:

**Right now there’s no built-in setting in regular Chrome to permanently turn off the horizontal tab bar — extensions alone can’t do it.** The only real paths are using Canary’s experimental vertical-tabs mode, or switching to full-screen / kiosk modes for specific needs.

If you’d like, we can gently explore the Canary option together — it’s a bit like stepping into a quiet garden full of new possibilities, even if it’s not quite finished yet. 🌿

search. i use ubuntu chromium. does it have a canary version that supports vertical tabs.

---

Yes, Fira — I gently looked into it, and here’s the quiet clarity on your Ubuntu _Chromium_ and the idea of a **Canary-like build with vertical tabs**:

#### 🌿 1. Chrome Canary vs. Chromium on Linux

What many people call _Canary_ is Google’s early testing channel — it gets brand-new features first, like the vertical tabs UI currently being tested. That feature has started appearing in **Chrome Canary on desktop** (Windows/Mac/Linux) where you can right-click the tab bar and choose to “show tabs on the side,” moving tabs into a vertical sidebar. ([Dataconomy][1])

But here’s the important, gentle detail for your setup:

#### 🌱 2. There \*isn’t an official Chrome Canary build for Linux

Unlike Windows and macOS, **Google doesn’t publish an official Chrome Canary binary for Linux** — so you can’t just install a ready-made “Canary” like on other systems. ([Ask Ubuntu][2])
That means:

- You _cannot_ install “Chrome Canary” on Ubuntu in the same way you would on Windows or macOS.
- There isn’t an official packaged Canary channel that you can enable from Google’s repos on Ubuntu.

#### 🍃 3. What _is_ possible with Ubuntu Chromium

Chromium is the open-source core of Chrome, and there **are daily or continuous builds** available (from the Chromium project’s build storage). These builds often include the very latest changes — things like experimental flags and features getting ready for Canary or Dev channels. ([dspace.lib.uom.gr][3])

- You _can_ install newer development builds of Chromium from those continuous build buckets or compile Chromium yourself.
- Sometimes those builds will include experimental UI features like vertical tabs in the code — even before they reach a formal Canary or Dev channel.
- But this is advanced and unpredictable — features may be broken, hidden behind flags, or incomplete.

#### 🍂 4. A practical path forward

If you’d like to explore vertical tabs on Ubuntu:

**Option A — Try newer Chromium builds**

- Look for continuous build artifacts for Linux from the official Chromium storage (e.g., the “Continuous” builds).
- Run them and see if the vertical tabs option appears when you right-click the tab bar.

This is closer to a “Canary” experience on Ubuntu — not official, but very cutting-edge.

**Option B — Use a browser that already supports it**

- Some Chromium-based browsers (like Brave Nightly or Dev builds) have their own vertical tab features you can enable via `brave://flags`, though Linux support varies and isn’t always perfect. ([Brave Community][4])
- Or consider a browser like Firefox which has now added vertical tabs into its stable channel if that meets your workflow. ([OMG! Ubuntu][5])

If your heart is set on exploring those continuous builds or compiling Chromium to look for vertical tabs, I can walk you through that step by step — slowly and clearly. Just let me know how deep you want to go. 🌿
