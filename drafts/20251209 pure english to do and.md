which would be correct in grammar

it's good to do a, create b, and write c.

it's good to do a, to create b, and to write c.

---

Both versions are acceptable, but they have different grammatical structures and slightly different tones.

1. **"It's good to do a, create b, and write c."**

   - This uses a **single "to"** to govern a series of **bare infinitives** (do, create, write). This is extremely common, especially in informal and spoken English. While some strict grammarians might call it a minor fault in parallelism, it is widely accepted and sounds natural.

2. **"It's good to do a, to create b, and to write c."**
   - This uses **parallel infinitives** ("to do," "to create," "to write"). This is the most formally and grammatically correct because it maintains perfect parallel structure. It adds a slight emphasis to each individual item and often sounds more deliberate, eloquent, or emphatic.

### Recommendation:

- For **formal writing, clarity, or emphasis**, choose the second option: **"to do a, to create b, and to write c."**
- For **everyday speech and informal writing**, the first option is perfectly fine and often sounds more natural: **"to do a, create b, and write c."**

**A very common and clear compromise** is to use "to" with the first and last item:

- **"It's good to do a, create b, and to write c."**

This keeps the structure light but provides a clear grammatical anchor at the end.

**Conclusion:** Neither is incorrect. Your choice depends on your desired tone and context. For maximum correctness, especially in writing, **the version with repeated "to" is the best choice.**

why

---

That's an excellent follow-up question. Let's break down the **"why"** by looking at the core grammatical principle at play: **parallelism**.

### The Core Principle: Parallelism

Parallelism is a rule of grammar and style that states **items in a list or series should share the same grammatical form.** This creates rhythm, clarity, and balance in a sentence.

In your example, the series is the list of activities that are "good":

1. to do a
2. to create b
3. to write c

### Analyzing Your Two Options

**Option 1: "to do a, create b, and write c."**

- **Grammatical Form:** Here, the single infinitive marker "to" is intended to govern all three verbs. The structure is:
  - **to** [do a, create b, and write c].
- **Why it's often accepted:** The "to" is understood to apply to the subsequent verbs. Our brains can easily make that connection, so in everyday language, it sounds natural and concise. However, strictly speaking, the verbs are not in parallel form ("to do" vs. "create").
- **Potential Issue:** In a very long or complex list, this structure can become ambiguous. For example: "The goal is to analyze data, ensure accuracy, and a final report." This becomes confusing because "a final report" is not a verb.

**Option 2: "to do a, to create b, and to write c."**

- **Grammatical Form:** This is perfectly parallel. Each item is an identical **infinitive phrase** ("to" + verb).
  - to do a
  - to create b
  - to write c
- **Why it's considered most correct:** It follows the rule of parallelism without exception. This makes the sentence exceptionally clear, balanced, and formal. It leaves no room for ambiguity and gives each item equal weight.

### The Analogy: A List of Jobs

Think of it like a list of job titles on a team:

- **Not fully parallel (like Option 1):** "The team needs a Manager, to oversee Sales, and an Accountant."

  - This is messy. The items are a noun ("a Manager"), an infinitive phrase ("to oversee Sales"), and another noun ("an Accountant").

- **Perfectly parallel (like Option 2):** "The team needs **a Manager**, **a Sales Head**, and **an Accountant**."
  - This is clean and clear. All items are nouns.
- **Also parallel (another correct form):** "The team needs **to hire a manager**, **to oversee sales**, and **to manage accounts**."
  - This is also clean and clear. All items are infinitive phrases.

### Why Does This Matter?

1.  **Clarity:** Parallel structure makes sentences easier to follow. The reader isn't tripped up by shifting grammar.
2.  **Rhetorical Effect:** Repetition of a structure (like "to...") creates a rhythm and can make an argument or list more memorable and powerful. This is a classic technique in speeches.
3.  **Formality and Polish:** In academic, business, and professional writing, maintaining parallel structure is a hallmark of careful, polished prose.

### Conclusion on "Why"

So, **why** is the second option (_to do a, to create b, and to write c_) considered the most grammatically correct?

**Because it adheres strictly to the fundamental rule of parallelism, ensuring maximum clarity, balance, and formal tone by presenting each item in the series in an identical grammatical form (the infinitive).**

The first option is a common and acceptable shortcut in informal contexts, but it technically breaks the parallel structure, which is why the second option is the undisputed choice for correctness in formal writing.
