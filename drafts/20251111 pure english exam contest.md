### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. Purpose and Goal

- **Exam:** The primary purpose is **assessment**. It measures an individual's knowledge, skill, or proficiency in a specific subject against a pre-defined standard or curriculum. The goal is to see if the test-taker has reached a required level of competence (e.g., passing a driving test, a final university exam).
- **Contest:** The primary purpose is **competition**. It pits individuals or teams against each other to determine who is the best in a particular field. The goal is to win, to be ranked higher than others (e.g., the Olympics, a coding competition, a poetry slam).

#### 2. Mindset and Psychology

- **Exam:** The mindset is often one of **anxiety and pressure to meet a minimum standard**. The focus is on avoiding failure and proving you have learned what was expected. It can be a solitary experience.
- **Contest:** The mindset is one of **ambition and a drive to excel**. The focus is on outperforming others and pushing the limits of one's ability. It often involves adrenaline, a "competitive spirit," and can be more collaborative within teams.

#### 3. Benchmark for Success

- **Exam:** Success is **absolute or criterion-referenced**. Your performance is measured against a fixed scale (e.g., 90% = A, 50% = Pass). It doesn't matter how others perform; if everyone scores 100%, everyone gets an A.
- **Contest:** Success is **relative or norm-referenced**. Your performance is measured directly against the performance of others. You can have a fantastic performance but still lose if someone else performs better. Winning a gold medal means you were the best _on that day_, not that you achieved a perfect score.

#### 4. Structure and Content

- **Exam:** Typically follows a **standardized format** based on a fixed syllabus. The questions are designed to cover the curriculum and are often predictable in style (multiple-choice, essays, etc.).
- **Contest:** Often features **novel, complex, or creative challenges** that go beyond a standard curriculum. It tests ingenuity, speed, and the ability to apply knowledge in unexpected ways (e.g., solving a never-before-seen math problem, creating an impromptu speech).

#### 5. Rewards and Outcomes

- **Exam:** Rewards are typically **credentials**: a diploma, a certificate, a license, a grade that allows you to move to the next level of education or employment.
- **Contest:** Rewards are typically **trophies and recognition**: a medal, a prize, cash, public acclaim, or a prestigious title (e.g., "National Champion").

### Similarities

Despite their differences, exams and contests share some common ground:

- **Preparation:** Both require significant dedication, practice, and study.
- **Performance Under Pressure:** Both test an individual's ability to perform in a timed, high-stakes environment.
- **Measurement of Ability:** Both are methods of measuring skill, knowledge, or talent, albeit for different ends.
- **Formal Setting:** Both are usually conducted in a formal, regulated setting with specific rules.

### Gray Areas and Overlaps

The line between an exam and a contest can sometimes blur:

- **Standardized Tests (like the SAT/GRE):** These are fundamentally **exams** because they measure against a standard. However, when used for highly competitive university admissions, they take on a **contest-like** nature, as students are effectively competing for a limited number of spots.
- **Scholarship Exams:** These are exams in format, but because only the top scorers get the award, they function as contests.
- **Graded "Practical Exams":** In fields like music or dance, a final recital is an exam needed to pass. However, if it's adjudicated with rankings and prizes, it becomes a contest (e.g., a piano competition).

### Summary

In essence, an **exam is a test of competence**, answering the question "Do you know enough?" A **contest is a test of comparison**, answering the question "Are you the best?"

You take an **exam** to prove you are **qualified**.
You enter a **contest** to prove you are **exceptional**.
