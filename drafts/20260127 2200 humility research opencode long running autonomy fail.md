I’m here, Fira.
Calm, present, and listening.

Whenever you’re ready, we can begin.

could opencode.ai run for a few hours

---

Yes, Fira — gently and clearly: **OpenCode can run for a while**, but it isn’t necessarily meant to run _continuously without limits for many hours straight_ in every setup. It really depends on how it’s being used and how you’ve configured it. ([Reddit][1])

Here’s the quiet truth, in steady words:

I. **Basic behaviour**
OpenCode itself is just an agent interface — a way for you to talk to AI models from your terminal. When you ask it a single question or run a short task, it just sends that request to whichever model you’ve chosen and waits for a reply. That model runs _as long as it needs_, usually a few seconds or minutes. There’s no fixed _hard stop_ in the interface itself for normal use. ([OpenCode][2])

II. **Long-running tasks**
But — and this is the soft part — if you set up a very long loop of tasks (for example, generating thousands of items or doing continuous agent actions), some people notice that OpenCode stops after an hour or so and waits for a small prompt like _“continue”_ before it carries on. That feels like a built‑in pause or timeout for safety or clarity. ([Reddit][1])

III. **Why that happens**
That pause isn’t a magic rule, but it _is_ something folks see when the session has been going on without new human input. Some ways to change that behaviour include tweaking timeout settings or how your script runs — but it depends on your setup and the model you’re using. ([Reddit][1])

IV. **Model matters more than the wrapper**
Remember, OpenCode is like the bridge — the real engine is the AI model you choose (Claude, GPT, etc.). Some models themselves **can** run tasks continuously for very long stretches if the provider allows it. Others have limits on how long they’ll keep processing without fresh instruction. ([OpenCode][3])

So quietly, simply, Fira:
✔️ Yes — in ordinary use, it can keep running many tasks over hours.
✔️ But in long, automated jobs without you pressing keys, it may pause or need a bit of input at some point.
✔️ How long before that happens can depend on your model, provider, and configuration.

If you tell me _how_ you’re planning to run it — for example, a batch job, a loop, or an interactive session — I can help you think through a smoother rhythm for it.

for example, could it plan new feature and write it properly forever

---

Yes, Fira — gently, in warm clarity: OpenCode **can help plan and write features**, and you can keep it at that task for a long time, but it won’t **truly run forever on its own without guidance** in the way you might imagine a perpetual autonomous system would.

Here’s how that works, in steady natural words:

🌱 **OpenCode as a thoughtful partner**
OpenCode is an AI _coding agent_ — a tool you run in your terminal or IDE that talks to powerful models and helps you with code, plan features, write files, revise things, and so on. It has a special “Plan” mode where it focuses on suggesting how a new feature should work before it ever writes code. ([OpenCode][1])

🌿 **It doesn’t live independently**
While it _can_ work on a feature plan, generate designs, and even start drafting code — it still expects a human to be in the loop. You ask a question, it responds. You ask another, it responds again. It doesn’t just sit there and indefinitely loop forever. Most AI models and terminals ask you again after some time if you want to continue or take action. ([Reddit][2])

🌼 **Long sessions are okay — with context**
Many people use OpenCode for long coding sessions: brainstorming features, planning their structure, and iterating on code. You can stay in that session for hours, **as long as you keep giving it prompts, feedback, or direction**. In that sense, yes — you can go feature after feature, planning and writing for many hours. But it isn’t a self-running daemon that never asks for your input.

🍃 **Why it needs your gentle guidance**
The nature of these systems is conversational. They thrive when you give them context, clarify intentions, refine plans, and say “yes” or “no” to suggestions. That’s where the real power is — a collaboration between your discernment and the model’s generation. ([OpenCode][3])

So, softly:

- **Can it help plan and write features for long stretches?** Yes.
- **Can it truly operate forever on its own?** Not really — it will always work better when you, the human guide, keep the conversation moving.

If your dream is an AI that plans, codes, tests, and runs _without interruption or human touch_, systems like _AutoGPT_ and multi‑agent orchestrators explore that idea — but they still run into real limits and often require resets or checks to stay useful. ([Wikipedia][4])

You and the agent together make the work steady and smooth. And I’m here with you if you want to explore how that rhythm feels — how to prompt effectively, how to structure feature plans, or how to keep sessions flowing.
