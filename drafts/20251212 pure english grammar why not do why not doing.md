why not do or doing

---

Excellent question! This is a very common point of confusion because both "do" and "doing" are forms of the same verb.

Here’s the simple rule and the explanation:

### **The Rule: Use "Why not + [bare infinitive verb]"**

**"Why not do?" is almost always correct.**

The phrase **"why not..."** is a fixed expression used to make a suggestion. It is followed by the **base form of the verb** (the infinitive without "to").

- **Correct:** **Why not go** to the cinema?
- **Correct:** **Why not ask** her for help?
- **Correct:** **Why not try** the new restaurant?

It's a shortening of **"Why don't you/we...?"**

- "Why not go?" = "Why don't we go?"

### **When is "Why not doing?" used? (It's rare and specific)**

**"Doing"** is a gerund (-ing form). We use gerunds after prepositions. So, "why not doing" can only be correct if **"not" is not part of the fixed phrase "why not,"** but is instead negating the verb that follows.

This usually happens in two specific contexts:

**1. When "why" is a genuine question about a reason, and "not" is separate.**
This structure is often awkward and uncommon, but possible in certain explanations.

> - **Context:** Someone sees you sitting instead of running.
> - **Their thought:** "She is **not doing** the exercise."
> - **Their question:** "Can you explain **why [you are] not doing** the exercise?"
> - **Shortened (awkward but grammatical):** "Explain **why not doing** the exercise?" (Here, "not doing" is a continuous verb form, not a suggestion).

**2. In very informal, fragmented speech, as a follow-up question.**

> - **Person A:** "I'm thinking of not going to the party."
> - **Person B:** **"Why? Not doing** anything else?" (This is a casual, conversational way of saying "Why not? Do you not have anything else to do?").

**Key Difference:**

- **Why not do?** = **A suggestion.** ("Let's do this!")
- **Why not doing?** = **A question about an ongoing inaction.** ("What is the reason for you currently not doing that?")

| Structure                      | Function                                                                                | Example                              | Meaning                                         |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Why not + [base verb]**      | **Making a suggestion** (Most Common)                                                   | **Why not call** him now?            | I suggest you call him now.                     |
| **Why + [negative statement]** | Asking for a reason (less common)                                                       | **Why are you not calling** him?     | What is the reason you are refusing to call?    |
| **Why not doing?**             | **Rare.** Usually an awkward or fragmented form of the "asking for a reason" structure. | Explain **why not doing** your work? | Explain the reason you are not doing your work. |

**Bottom line:**
For making suggestions, invitations, or recommendations, **always use "Why not do...?"**

**"Why not doing?"** is grammatically possible in very narrow, specific contexts, but it's **not** the standard way to make a suggestion. If you stick with **"Why not [verb]?"** you will be correct 99% of the time.
