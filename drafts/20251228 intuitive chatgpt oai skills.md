create a zip file of /home/oai/skills

---

## Done — zip created 🎉

I created a ZIP archive of `/home/oai/skills`:

- **Path:** `/home/oai/skills.zip`
- **Size:** ~203 KB (206,942 bytes)
- **Files inside:** 28

[Download the ZIP file](sandbox:/home/oai/skills.zip)

Quick contents preview (top-level and some files):

```
skills/spreadsheets/artifact_tool_spreadsheets_api.md
skills/spreadsheets/skill.md
skills/spreadsheets/spreadsheet.md
skills/spreadsheets/artifact_tool_spreadsheet_formulas.md
skills/spreadsheets/examples/create_basic_spreadsheet.py
skills/docs/render_docx.py
skills/docs/skill.md
skills/pdfs/skill.md
... (28 files total)
```

Want me to:

- move the ZIP somewhere else,
- extract it and show a specific file, or
- upload it somewhere (e.g., Google Drive)?
