create a single page web app. it's like a telegram copy. 

- first
  - show a textarea for pasting dialog.
  - dialog: different messages have one line space between each other. if a message starts with (abc:), it's from abc.
- then
  - render the messages. use #000 as background. 
  - message bubbles have maxinum border radius. 
  - if a message doesnt have an author, use #1F2326 as background, and put it on the left. 
  - if a message have an author, use gradient #8848BA #7944CA #6C60E6 from top to bottom, put it on the right, put the author at the first line and make it bold (other styles are the same with the message), and next line is the message.
  - line breaks inside a message should be well rendered.
    - if a message, like `a (2025.01.01 07:21): hello` have multiple colons, only recognize the last one. the author can be at any length, but will not appear after the first line of a message.
- design
  - dont show any other stuff like a title
  - the textarea should be on the left and the messages should be on the right
  - the textarea should be in sync with the messages
  - the textarea should have css `opacity:30%`, no visible scroll bar, not attracting viewer's eyes.
  - the textarea shouldnt have placeholder and always being focused.
