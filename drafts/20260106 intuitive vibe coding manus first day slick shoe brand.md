make a website that's a landing page for a shoe brand with slick animations and shoe style layouts with very cool clicks, and the design of the website should jsut be flexing with animations!

---

Got it! I'll create a stunning landing page for a shoe brand with slick animations and interactive elements that really flex the design.

Initialize web project with static scaffold

Since the project setup is complete, I'll proceed to create the static web scaffold to start designing the landing page with initial structure.

Design and implement animated landing page with shoe layouts

I confirmed the project scaffold, which uses React, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui. Next, I’ll enhance the landing page with polished, high-end design elements, focusing on aesthetics and interactions.

Creating fileshoe-brand-landing/ideas.md

I have brainstormed three distinct design directions for the STRIDE landing page:

1.  **Cyber-Kinetic Futurism**: A high-energy, dark-mode aesthetic with neon accents, focusing on speed, precision, and technical innovation.
2.  **Organic Brutalism**: A raw, street-culture inspired look with bold typography, collage elements, and a tactile feel.
3.  **Ethereal Levitation**: A clean, minimalist, and light design emphasizing weightlessness and comfort with soft gradients and floating elements.

I will proceed with **Cyber-Kinetic Futurism** as it best aligns with the request for "slick animations," "flexing," and "very cool clicks." This style allows for the most aggressive and impressive use of motion and interactive effects.

**Design Philosophy: Cyber-Kinetic Futurism**

- **Core Principles**: Velocity, Precision, Immersion, Fluidity.
- **Color Palette**: Deep Obsidian (#050505) base with Neon Volt (#CCFF00) and Hyper Violet (#7F00FF) accents.
- **Typography**: Wide, bold headers (Monument Extended/Druk Wide style) paired with technical monospace body text.
- **Key Features**: Velocity skew on scroll, magnetic cursors, glitch effects, and 3D-style floating shoe presentations.

I will now generate the necessary assets and begin building the interface.

To create a slick, cyber-futuristic design for the landing page, focusing on neon accents, bold typography, and immersive motion effects. Next, I'll develop interactive elements based on this concept.

I've generated high-quality futuristic shoe images, confirming the cyber-futuristic neon aesthetic. Updated styles now feature bold neon colors, sharp edges, and immersive motion effects for the landing page. Next, I'll integrate these visual assets into the design.

Deploy and present the landing page to user

Completed the cyber-futuristic landing page with custom cursor, glitch effects, and scroll animations. Next, I will test responsiveness and optimize performance. Attachment: manus-webdev://081b9c2f Suggestions: add interactive shoe showcases, enhance mobile responsiveness, incorporate user hover effects.

I have successfully built the **STRIDE** landing page with a **Cyber-Kinetic Futurism** aesthetic. The site features a custom magnetic cursor, glitch text effects, and smooth scroll animations that reveal technical details as you explore. The design uses a deep obsidian background with neon volt accents to create a high-performance, futuristic feel.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Interactive 3D Model**: Integrate a real 3D model viewer (using Three.js) for the hero shoe to allow users to rotate and inspect it from all angles.
2.  **Sound Design**: Add subtle audio cues on hover and scroll (like digital hums or clicks) to deepen the immersive experience.
3.  **Pre-Order Flow**: Build out the "Pre-Order" modal with a form to capture user interest and emails.
