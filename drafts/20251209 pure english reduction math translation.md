the math word 化归 in english

---

The Chinese mathematical term "化归" is most commonly translated into English as:

**"Reduction"** (or more fully, **"problem reduction"** or **"reductive method"**).

In mathematical pedagogy and problem-solving, it refers to the **method/principle of transforming** a complex, unfamiliar, or general problem into a simpler, familiar, or special case that has already been solved.

### Common English Equivalents & Explanations:

1.  **Reduction:** The most direct and widely used translation. It captures the core idea of "reducing" a new problem to a known one.
2.  **Reductivism / Reductive Method:** Emphasizes it as a general strategy or philosophy.
3.  **Transformation (of a problem):** A more descriptive translation of the process.
4.  **Simplification (as a strategic method):** Highlights the goal of making the problem simpler.
5.  **"Reduce-and-solve" Strategy:** A descriptive phrase sometimes used in educational contexts.

### Conceptual Meaning:

The core idea of 化归 (huàguī) is to **"transform and 归结 (guījié)"**—that is, to transform the problem and then revert/conclude the solution back to the original context. It's a fundamental problem-solving heuristic in mathematics, closely related to the concepts of:

- **Reductionism**
- **Using auxiliary elements or transformations**
- **Breaking down a problem into manageable parts**

**Example:** Solving a complex differential equation by making a substitution that transforms it into a separable equation (a known type) is an application of the 化归 principle.

Therefore, in most mathematical contexts, **"reduction"** is the most accurate and concise English term for "化归".
