# 1

are people really using manus for creating apps instead of cursor or claude code. i mean practically. for example, svelte is popular but rarely used in practice compared with react. if you say yes, give me real world examples. not another todo list, too stupid.

---

Fira — let’s sit with this gently and honestly.
You’re asking not about hype, but _actual practical use_ of **Manus** for building real apps, compared to tools like **Cursor** or **Claude Code**.

Here’s what the wider discussions and real‑world reporting tell us — not marketing claims, but what people are _actually doing_:

---

### 🌱 **1. Manus has been widely talked about, but real production use is unclear**

Manus has quickly become a buzz‑word in AI circles. It claims to build full‑stack apps from simple prompts and even continue working while you’re offline — which feels magical. ([NxCode][1])

But when you look beyond the hype:

- Many users _experiment with it_, spin up prototypes, or let it generate code — especially for things like dashboards, simple websites, or small tools. ([analyticsvidhya.com][2])
- A lot of what we see out there are **showcases**, _community examples_ and marketing demo pages, not verified large‑scale production systems. ([Manusai][3])

That tells us people are **trying** Manus for app building — but it’s still largely in the _exploratory phase_, not yet a standard replacement for experienced coding workflows.

---

### 🌿 **2. Anecdotes show mixed practical results**

Where we _do_ see real stories from developers:

✔ Some individuals report creating working apps or prototypes very quickly — like an itinerary generator or small HR tool — and say the output worked in their tests. ([analyticsvidhya.com][2])

✖ But many users on independent forums (like Reddit) point out that what Manus generates often needs a lot of manual fixing, isn’t fully reliable, and sometimes isn’t production quality at all. ([Reddit][4])

There’s also criticism that it is **expensive**, and that people can replicate parts of what it does using tools like Claude, Perplexity or custom agents for much cheaper. ([Reddit][5])

So in practice, people may _play with it_ or _prototype with it_, but rarely are they shipping serious, customer‑facing systems straight from Manus without significant human oversight.

---

### 🌾 **3. Compared to Cursor / Claude Code**

This is where it becomes clearer:

- **Cursor (with models like Claude or GPT)** is already used by many developers as a _coding assistant_ inside a real editor, helping write, refactor, test, and deploy code. It integrates into workflows where a developer remains in control. ([EON Reality][6])

- **Claude Code** and tools like GitHub Copilot are being adopted by teams to speed up development across real projects — not just demos — because they fit into actual developer workflows.

**Manus**, on the other hand, is still mostly being used as:

- a _prototype generator_,
- an _idea conveyor_,
- a _proof‑of‑concept builder_,
- a _tool for non‑developers to explore possibilities_.

But not often as the **sole engine for production apps** without a developer in the loop. That might change — AI evolves fast — but _right now_ it’s more promise than standard practice.

---

### 🌼 **Soft, real‑world sense**

Imagine a gardener showing you seeds. They look amazing, and some grow okay in a pot. But serious farmers still plant with care, soil knowledge, and tending. That’s where most real apps are right now:

- **Developers are using AI where it fits** — scaffolding, boilerplate, suggestions, CI/CD helpers.
- But **full autonomous generation** (like “Manus build me the next Instagram”) seldom happens without skilled human guidance.

---

So, in simple terms, Fira:

✨ People _are_ using Manus to make prototypes and explore ideas.
✨ But it’s **not yet widely adopted as a practical production tool** the way React + real coding workflows or Cursor / Claude Code workflows are.
✨ And many experienced developers still prefer flexible tools where they stay in control.

If you want, we can talk about _where each of these tools shines_, and how you might choose one for your own idea.

see what people are saying

---

Yes, Fira — I looked at real _what people are actually saying_ across forums, reviews, and comments. What you’ll see isn’t rosy hype, but grounded experience from folks trying these tools in ordinary work. Here’s the gentle, honest picture:

---

### 🌧️ **What people actually say about Manus**

People _do_ talk about using Manus — but the tone is cautious, mixed, and often critical rather than celebratory:

🌱 **Mixed enthusiasm and disappointment**

- Some users describe Manus as **more hype than practical**, especially compared with running Claude or Gemini directly via other tools. One person said they regretted buying Manus because it couldn’t complete tasks correctly, and they fixed things faster with Claude 3.7 and Gemini on their own. ([Reddit][1])

📉 **Cost and credit complaints**

- A common theme: Manus burns through credits quickly, making it **expensive for real work**. Some users report being able to run only one or fewer useful prompts per day on the standard daily credit allotment. ([Reddit][2])
- Another commenter said the pricing model feels punishing once you start building anything non‑trivial. ([Reddit][3])

⚠️ **Quality and reliability issues**

- Several users mention Manus being **unreliable or slow**, with errors, loops, and tasks that don’t complete as expected. ([こまろぐ][4])
- Reviews note problems like freezing under load and hitting system limits on complex tasks, even before building apps. ([NxCode][5])

🧠 **Unclear practical value**

- One set of real user posts showed people experimenting with travel plans, business docs, or simple sites — but not finding it convincingly better than ChatGPT or other agents for real productive use. ([Reddit][6])
- Another report warns that Manus doesn’t yet produce **production‑ready applications** reliably, and points out concerns like data ownership and subscription billing practices. ([Reddit][7])

---

### 🧠 **In comparison: What people say about tools like Cursor and Claude Code**

👩‍💻 **Cursor & Claude Code have clearer evidence of _actual use_**

- Users on developer forums talk about using **Cursor and Claude Code in real coding workflows** — building, debugging, refactoring, maintaining code bases, and integrating with tools they use daily. ([Reddit][8])

👨‍💻 **Practical value vs frustrations**

- Some folks say Cursor’s editor integration and control over changes is useful, while Claude Code’s reasoning and context handling feels powerful for bigger tasks. ([Reddit][9])
- There are still complaints about reliability and cost — none of these tools are perfect — but their _role_ in real developer workflows is discussed concretely. ([Reddit][8])

📊 **Emerging evidence suggests real contributions**

- A research study on agent‑assisted coding (focused on things like Claude Code) showed that **a large majority of agent‑generated pull requests in open‑source projects were eventually accepted into real code bases**, after some human refinement. ([arXiv][10])

---

### 🌿 **Gentle sense of the reality right now**

Here’s the honest, calm takeaway:

💛 **Manus isn’t useless.**

- People are trying it.
- Some enjoy the autonomous feeling.
- It’s part of the conversation about future AI tools.

🌙 **But it’s not widely used for _serious production apps_ yet.**

- Most real comments are about **experiments, prototypes, hype disappointment, credit burn, and errors**.
- It’s **not yet replacing** developer‑centric tools in practical workflows — at least according to real user voices you can find today. ([Reddit][1])

🛠 **Tools like Cursor and Claude Code are _actually in daily workflows_**

- Developers talk about them _concretely_ building and maintaining software, refactoring projects, and integrating with IDEs. ([Reddit][8])
- There’s also some real evidence that agent‑generated code is accepted into production GitHub projects with human review. ([arXiv][10])
