# how to install and setup persistent browser profile on patchright in js

To install and set up a persistent browser profile with **Patchright** in Node.js, install the package along with real Google Chrome and launch the browser using **`chromium.launchPersistentContext()`**. [](https://scrapewise.ai/blogs/what-is-patchright-guide-2026)

### 1\. Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal to install Patchright and the recommended browser binary: [](https://scrapewise.ai/blogs/what-is-patchright-guide-2026)

bash

```
npm install patchright
npx patchright install chrome

```



* **Use real Chrome.** Patchright recommends `chrome` over bundled `chromium` for maximum stealth and compatibility.
* **Verify your imports.** Ensure your project imports from `patchright` rather than `playwright`, as leaving an old import will silently use the unpatched driver. [](https://github.com/openonion/connectonion/issues/168)

### 2\. Persistent Profile Setup (JavaScript)

Instead of calling `chromium.launch()`, use `chromium.launchPersistentContext()` and pass a local folder path to `userDataDir`. Cookies, `localStorage`, IndexedDB, and active login sessions will automatically save to that folder and reload on future runs. [](https://github.com/lipski-lite/nativewright)

javascript

```
const { chromium } = require('patchright');
const path = require('path');

(async () => {
  // Define the folder where your profile data will be saved
  const userDataDir = path.join(__dirname, 'my-chrome-profile');

  // Launch persistent context using Patchright's recommended stealth settings
  const context = await chromium.launchPersistentContext(userDataDir, {
    channel: 'chrome',     // Uses real Google Chrome instead of Chromium
    headless: false,       // Headed mode avoids headless detection flags
    viewport: null         // Disables fixed viewport sizing (equivalent to no_viewport)
  });

  // Persistent contexts open with a default blank page; reuse it instead of opening a new one
  const page = context.pages()[0] || await context.newPage();

  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  console.log('Page Title:', await page.title());

  // Always close the context gracefully so session data flushes to disk
  await context.close();
})();

```



### 3\. Best Practices for Stealth & Reliability

Follow the guidelines from the [Scrapewise Patchright Guide](https://scrapewise.ai/blogs/what-is-patchright-guide-2026) to keep the profile undetected and prevent corruption: [](https://scrapewise.ai/blogs/what-is-patchright-guide-2026)

* **Avoid custom overrides.** Do not set custom `userAgent` strings or extra HTTP headers in the launch options, as they create fingerprint mismatches. [](https://github.com/openonion/connectonion/issues/168)
* **Run one instance per profile.** A `userDataDir` locks while in use, so launching two scripts against the same profile folder simultaneously will cause an error. [](https://playwright.dev/mcp/configuration/user-profile)
* **Seed logins manually.** Run the script once with `headless: false` and a pause (or `page.waitForTimeout()`), log into your accounts manually, and close the browser. Subsequent runs pointing to the same `userDataDir` will start already authenticated. [](https://github.com/lipski-lite/nativewright)
* **Use a virtual display on Linux servers.** Because `headless: false` is recommended for stealth, pair your script with `xvfb-run` when deploying to headless Linux environments. [](https://scrapewise.ai/blogs/what-is-patchright-guide-2026)

If you'd like to tailor this setup further, let me know:

* Whether you are running this on **Windows/macOS** or a **Linux server** (for `xvfb` setup)
* If you need **TypeScript / ES Module** syntax instead of CommonJS

I can adjust the launch configuration or provide deployment steps to match your environment.
