### The Bottom Line

- If you're talking about **wide-ranging scope or extensive coverage** (of knowledge, experience, selection), you almost always want **breadth**.
- If you're talking about **physical width**, you can use **broadness**, but you could also often just say "width" or "the broad [something]" (e.g., "his broad shoulders").
- If you're criticizing something for being **too general or non-specific**, **broadness** is the apt choice. Using "breadth" here would sound incorrect.

**Think of it this way:** **Breadth** is about **how much is included**. **Broadness** is about **how wide or non-specific something is.**
