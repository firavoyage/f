im creating a math language like latex, making math expressions easy in ascii. give me problems with solution ranged from primary school to high school demonstating math features.

Of course! This is a fantastic project. The key is to create a syntax that is intuitive for someone typing on a standard keyboard, while still being unambiguous and powerful enough for complex expressions.

Let's define a sample syntax for our language, which we'll call **"MathType"** for this demonstration.

### Problems and Solutions with MathType

Here are problems ranging from primary to high school, with their solutions written in our MathType syntax.

#### **Primary School (Grades 1-5)**

**Problem 1: Basic Arithmetic**

> Sarah had 5 apples. She bought 7 more. Then she gave 3 to her friend. How many apples does she have now?

_Solution:_
`5 + 7 - 3 = 9`

> She has `9` apples.

**Problem 2: Fractions**

> A pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. John eats 3 slices. What fraction of the pizza did John eat?

_Solution:_
`3/8`

> John ate `3/8` of the pizza.

**Problem 3: Area**

> What is the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 cm and a width of 4 cm?

_Solution:_
`A = l * w = 10 * 4 = 40`

> The area is `40 cm^2`.

---

#### **Middle School (Grades 6-8)**

**Problem 4: Solving for a Variable**

> Solve for `x`: `2x + 5 = 13`

_Solution:_

```
2x + 5 = 13
2x = 13 - 5
2x = 8
x = 8 / 2
x = 4
```

**Problem 5: Pythagorean Theorem**

> A right-angled triangle has legs of length 6 and 8. What is the length of the hypotenuse?

_Solution:_
`c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(6^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10`

> The hypotenuse is `10`.

**Problem 6: Volume**

> What is the volume of a cylinder with a radius of 3 m and a height of 5 m? (Use `pi`).

_Solution:_
`V = pi * r^2 * h = pi * (3)^2 * 5 = pi * 9 * 5 = 45pi`

> The volume is `45pi m^3`.

---

#### **High School (Grades 9-12)**

**Problem 7: Quadratic Formula**

> Solve for `x`: `x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0`

_Solution:_
`x = (5 ± sqrt((-5)^2 - 4*1*6)) / (2*1) = (5 ± sqrt(25 - 24)) / 2 = (5 ± sqrt(1)) / 2 = (5 ± 1)/2`
`x_1 = (5 + 1)/2 = 3`
`x_2 = (5 - 1)/2 = 2`

> The solutions are `x = 2` and `x = 3`.

**Problem 8: Trigonometry**

> Find the exact value of `sin(pi/3) * cos(pi/3)`.

_Solution:_
`sin(pi/3) = sqrt(3)/2`
`cos(pi/3) = 1/2`
`sin(pi/3) * cos(pi/3) = (sqrt(3)/2) * (1/2) = sqrt(3)/4`

> The value is `sqrt(3)/4`.

**Problem 9: Calculus - Derivative**

> Find the derivative of `f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + x - 5`.

_Solution:_
`f'(x) = d/dx (3x^4) - d/dx (2x^2) + d/dx (x) - d/dx (5)`
`f'(x) = 12x^3 - 4x + 1`

> The derivative is `12x^3 - 4x + 1`.

**Problem 10: Calculus - Definite Integral**

> Evaluate the integral `int_1^4 (2x + 1) dx`.

_Solution:_
`F(x) = int (2x + 1) dx = x^2 + x + C`
`int_1^4 (2x + 1) dx = F(4) - F(1) = ((4)^2 + (4)) - ((1)^2 + (1)) = (16 + 4) - (1 + 1) = 20 - 2 = 18`

> The value of the integral is `18`.

**Problem 11: Logarithms**

> Solve for `x`: `log_2(x) + log_2(x + 2) = 3`

_Solution:_
`log_2( x * (x + 2) ) = 3` (Using product rule)
`2^3 = x * (x + 2)` (Converting from logarithmic to exponential form)
`8 = x^2 + 2x`
`x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0`
`(x + 4)(x - 2) = 0`
`x = -4` or `x = 2`

> Since the domain of `log_2(x)` is `x > 0`, the only solution is `x = 2`.

### Implementation Note:

When you build your parser, you'll need to handle **order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)** carefully. For example, `a / b * c` could be ambiguous—should it be `(a/b)*c` or `a/(b*c)`? Using parentheses `()` generously in your syntax will be crucial for clarity. Your parser should treat `a / b c` as a syntax error and require explicit parentheses for `a/(b*c)`.

This should give you a great foundation with examples to test your language against! Good luck with your project.
