Let them run on the same port. Postgres. Vite. Express.

precious, [2/7/26 8:36 PM]
By default I will create a skill called chemistry. Prepare will know the prompt from the context. First read the skill. Then read the progress. Then ask and write. Read results are in the context, currently as a prompt.

precious, [2/7/26 8:36 PM]
Now I'm gonna hook prepare to get the prompt directly. Ofc I could know the state. I could read the progress myself.

Metro assume songs from the same album should have the same cover art, ignoring what the file is. Holyshit.

precious, [2/10/26 3:42 PM]
Fix magically. Toggle a few settings. Idk. Thumbnails folder is irrelevant.

precious, [2/10/26 3:46 PM]
Find cause: toggle settings - images - ignore media store covers off and on. Seems the deeper cause is the app is imperative instead of declarative. It's not pure. 

If everything is a state, toggling off and on should behave the exact same.

Abstract with load. 

Load tool description. Load tool fn. 

Plan. Act. 

Compute/tools/... 

.humility/... 

Whatever. 

Btw. How does Python do that. Battery included. Built-in libraries. Official libraries. User installed libraries. Although it has an installation... Anyway.

precious, [2/13/26 3:22 PM]
Spec. 

Design fn. Don't decide naming and taxonomy. Although you can suggest. 

Design call flow or deps. Design testing.

precious, [2/13/26 3:31 PM]
Broadness and depth.

precious, [2/13/26 3:31 PM]

Full automation means it will never stop.

precious, [2/13/26 3:32 PM]
Guidance means it will question the question. It will point out risks if you don't explicitly ignore. It doesn't trust you. Explicit over implicit.

On telegram you could create link previews. You could move up, enlarge/shrink photo, and apply changes. But you could not just disable by default. At least I don't see it when sending messages.

Btw, I don't think there should be apply changes. Such button should only exist in professional softwares for irreversible actions.

It seems that there exists such an option. But doesn't work. Maybe only apply to secret chats.

On bird you could swipe the top bar to switch chats. You can pull down to view all maybe. On the bottom of a chat you swipe down to the next unread chat, maybe you could disable this. 

Avatar. Name. Msg Lr Alignment. You could choose whether to show. 

Use verbs. Instead of a list. See news. Check the status of friends. Chat. They are different. Not inside the same list.

precious, [2/13/26 7:29 PM]
How far could it go... Self correction is simple. Tell it to check itself. Validate or evaluate maybe. Fact check maybe. Testing in software engineering. And get the response.

Skill. Research. Inference.

Guidance. Automation. Control. Safety. They are not essence. They are a way of abstraction. Think bottom up sometimes.

precious, [2/14/26 9:45 AM]
Bottom up. You must add structure to the prompt. That's plan. You must parse and act. You can have decorators. You can store history and config with a good taxonomy. 

Top down. You shouldn't optimize. You should solve some fundamental problems. Like self correction, fact check, think different when getting stuck. In the form of listeners or intervals. 

Others are good to have.

precious, [2/14/26 11:12 AM]
I suddenly recall this. 

Declarative > Imperative 

Explicit > Implicit 

Oop is on top of fp. As a syntax sugar it's good. As an abstraction it could be redundant. Fp is the essence.
