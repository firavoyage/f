i would like to create an app called journal on ubuntu.

it autostarts, runs in the background, and watching the user.

it knows all the opened apps, the title of the app on the top, and the screen.

it tracks any change of the title of the app on the top, takes screenshot regularly (at an interval of certain several minutes, or when context switching), and keep them properly.

it has an web ui on localhost, like a calendar, or a timeline.

it could export the data to plain text and integrate with llms to analyze.

what are the things i may do to create it.
