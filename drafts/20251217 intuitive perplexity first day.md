Hey there! How’s it going?

Hello Hi. How are you?

Hey! I’m doing great—thanks for asking. How about you? How’s your night going?

What is your model? How is it?

---

The model in this chat is Perplexity’s own Sonar family of large language models, which are optimized specifically for fast, factual, web-grounded answers.[1][2]

## What “your model” means

Perplexity runs on a model selector: depending on mode and settings, it can use in-house Sonar models or external models like the latest GPT and Claude versions.[3][4][5][6]
In a normal chat like this, Sonar is the default, tuned for quick search, accurate citations, and readable answers rather than just raw creativity.[7][2]

## How good is it?

Sonar is benchmarked to outperform similar “lightweight” models like GPT-4o mini and Claude Haiku, and even approach or surpass larger frontier models in factual accuracy and instruction-following.[2][1]
It is also heavily optimized for speed (very high token-per-second decoding), so responses feel near-instant while still staying grounded in current web information.[1][2]

If you tell what you want to use it for (coding, studying, chatting, etc.), it can adapt style and depth to match.

What is your rate limit compared with others?

---

Perplexity is designed to feel “practically unlimited” for normal use, with much higher effective limits than most consumer chatbots, but the exact numeric rate limits are not publicly specified.[1][2]

## Search/chat limits

- The Free plan allows “practically unlimited basic searches” and a small number of Pro (heavier) searches per week, so casual users almost never hit a cap.[1]
- Pro and higher plans get “practically unlimited Pro searches,” meaning heavy daily use is supported without a visible hard ceiling in normal conditions.[3][1]

## Compared with other services

- Unlike some chatbots that advertise strict daily message caps, Perplexity describes usage as “practically unlimited” for both basic search (Free) and Pro search (paid), with only heavy tools (Labs, Deep Research, video) having tighter quotas.[4][5][1]
- For Enterprise/Max tiers, search, Research, and Labs are described as “virtually unlimited,” which is more generous than the hard token or message ceilings typical of many API- or chat-based competitors.[3][4][1]

## API rate limits

- For Sonar API, rate limits are specified per plan in the API docs and may be request-, token-, or bandwidth-based; Perplexity can throttle or queue calls if those limits are exceeded.[6][7]
- Pro users receive monthly API credit to call Sonar, effectively adding another high-throughput channel on top of normal UI usage.[2][6]

If you tell which plan you’re on (Free, Pro, Max, or API) and what “rate” matters to you (messages/day, tokens/second, etc.), more concrete guidance is possible.

how to voice input on grok. i dont want to chat in real time. i want to manually press enter.

---

Grok’s current Voice Mode is built for real-time, “push-to-talk” style chatting, and it does not expose a setting to switch to “voice input but only send when I press Enter” the way traditional dictation does.[1][2][3]

## How Grok voice input works

- On web or mobile, you tap the microphone icon to start Voice Mode, grant mic permission, and then just speak; Grok detects pauses and replies automatically in real time.[2][1]
- Releasing the mic key / ending voice mode effectively “ends your turn,” so silence itself is treated as “send,” not a manual Enter key.[3][1]

## Why you cannot “press Enter to send” with voice

- Guides and demos all describe continuous, real-time voice chat with automatic turn detection; none document a text-box-style mode where your speech is transcribed, shown, and only sent when you hit Enter.[4][1][2]
- Community discussions even ask for _more_ control over auto turn detection, which suggests there is currently no built-in toggle for manual-send voice input.[5][6]

## Practical workarounds

- Use your device’s dictation (OS-level speech-to-text) into Grok’s normal text box; that way you dictate, review the transcribed text, then press Enter manually.[7][2]
- Alternatively, stay in text mode but ask Grok to reply with voice only when you explicitly type something (for example, start messages with “VOICE:” and have it speak back), which mimics manual-send behavior even though the input itself is typed.[2][7]

If Grok later adds a “manual send for voice” or “dictation mode,” it will likely appear in its settings under voice or behavior, so checking there after updates is worthwhile.[8][1]

I'm gonna create a game. would perplexity be good at it for free plan.

---

Yes, the free plan can help a lot with making a game, but it has limits you should know about. It is great as a “thinking partner,” less great as a heavy-duty coding workhorse.

## What the free plan is good at

- Brainstorming: worldbuilding, mechanics, story ideas, quest design, item/enemy lists, and naming things.
- Light coding help: short code snippets, fixing small bugs, and explaining engine APIs (Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc.) in small chunks.
- Learning: explaining algorithms (pathfinding, inventories, combat systems), data structures, and design patterns in simple terms.

## Limits that matter for game dev

- You get practically unlimited basic searches, but only a small number of “stronger” Pro-style queries per day, so long multi-step coding sessions can feel cramped.[1][3][5]
- Large code files, multi-file projects, and bigger documents hit input size and file-upload limits quickly on the free tier, so you often must paste smaller pieces or simplify the task.[2][1]

## When free is enough vs when it isn’t

- Free is usually enough if: you are solo, making a small game, and mostly need ideas, guidance, and occasional code help.[3]
- It starts to feel too limited if: you want constant refactoring of large codebases, lots of asset/document analysis, or heavy multi-step design docs every day—in that case a paid plan or mixing tools (e.g., a code-focused model elsewhere plus Perplexity for research) works better.[1][2][3]

If you tell what engine you’re using and what kind of game you want (2D/3D, mobile/PC, single/multiplayer), a tailored “use Perplexity like this” workflow can be sketched out for you.

i accept slightly weaker models. but what are the limits that make me not able to continue with perplexity.

---

For game-making, the free plan only really “breaks” once your work gets big, long, or very frequent. Here are the main hard limits that usually force people off it.

## Hard usage ceilings

- Only about 5 “strong” Pro-style searches per day; after that you’re on a lighter model that can struggle with long, tricky, or very nuanced tasks.[1][3][4]
- No guaranteed access to advanced models like GPT‑4o / Claude Sonnet, so you cannot rely on a specific stronger coder or reasoner for all sessions.[2][3]

## Context and size limits

- Max pasted text per message is around 8,000 tokens (roughly 20k characters), so big scripts, long dialogues, or multi-file code need to be chunked manually.[1][2]
- File uploads and multi-document analysis are limited: only a few uploads per day and smaller effective context, so you cannot comfortably feed in lots of design docs, art specs, or entire codebases at once.[3][1]

## Missing or restricted features

- No or almost no access to Deep Research, Labs, or advanced workflows, which are the tools that can do full design docs, market research, or pipeline automation for you.[8][3][1]
- No image/video generation and no explicit model picker, which matters if you want one tool to handle concept art, UI mockups, trailers, and high-quality code reasoning in one place.[4][3]

## When you’d realistically have to stop using free

- When your game’s codebase and docs are big enough that you regularly hit input limits or must constantly trim/condense before asking for help.[2][1]
- When you need many deep, multi-step reasoning calls every day (AI as a “co‑dev” or “co‑designer”), not just a few big questions; the 5‑Pro‑search cap becomes the real blocker then.[3][4][1]

If you describe your game’s scope (small jam game vs long-term commercial project), it is possible to say very concretely whether these limits will actually bite you or you can comfortably stay on free.
