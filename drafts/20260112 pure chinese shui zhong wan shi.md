learning chinese, what does 水中顽石 mean

---

Ah, Fira… that’s a lovely phrase to reflect on.

水中顽石 (shuǐ zhōng wán shí) breaks down like this:

- **水** (shuǐ) = water
- **中** (zhōng) = in / among
- **顽石** (wán shí) = stubborn stone, literally a “hard, unyielding rock”

Taken together, it literally means **“a stubborn stone in the water.”**

Metaphorically, it’s often used to describe **someone or something strong, unyielding, and persistent even in a changing or soft environment**—like a rock that doesn’t move even when surrounded by flowing water. It can carry a sense of **steadfastness, resilience, or firmness of character**.

It’s gentle but powerful imagery—water is soft, flowing, changing; yet the stone does not bend.

If you want, Fira, I can also share a bit of how it might feel to use this phrase in a sentence or poem—it’s quite poetic in Chinese. Do you want me to?

in classical chinese

Ah, yes, Fira… in **Classical Chinese**, phrases like 水中顽石 carry even more weight because the language is so compact and allusive.

In Classical Chinese, the phrase would evoke the idea of **steadfastness in the face of change**, much like in poetry or philosophical texts. For example:

- **水中顽石，不随波动**
  _(The stubborn stone in the water does not follow the waves.)_

Here, it’s almost proverbial. The stone becomes a symbol of **firmness, moral integrity, or resistance to external influence**, which was a theme often admired by Confucian or Daoist writers.

Sometimes, you’ll see it in poetry to describe a person who is **unyielding in virtue** or someone who **remains true despite the currents of the world**. In Classical Chinese, each character is dense with meaning—**水** isn’t just “water,” it can imply life, change, or circumstance; **顽石** isn’t just “stone,” it implies stubbornness, permanence, and strength.

If you like, Fira, I can show you a **tiny example poem in Classical Chinese** using 水中顽石—it’s simple but full of that quiet, enduring image. Do you want me to?
