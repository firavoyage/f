how to search english vtubers on youtube jp. i searched "vtuber en" but it still recommended jp ones.

---

Of course! This is a common issue because YouTube's recommendation algorithm is heavily influenced by your location, watch history, and the language of the interface. Searching on YouTube Japan (YouTube JP) makes it especially tricky.

Here’s a comprehensive guide with strategies, from simple to advanced, to find English VTubers even on the Japanese site.

### 1. Use More Specific & Effective Search Terms

The keyword "EN" is often used by Japanese fans to talk about English VTubers, so it gets mixed in. Try these more targeted searches:

- **`EN VTuber`** (sometimes the order matters)
- **`English VTuber`**
- **`海外VTuber`** (_Kaigai VTuber_ - means "Overseas VTuber")
- **`英語VTuber`** (_Eigo VTuber_ - means "English Language VTuber")
- Search for **specific famous English VTuber agencies**:
  - **`hololive English`** or **`hololive EN`**
  - **`Nijisanji EN`** (or their official name **`Nijisanji English`**)
  - **`VShojo`** (This agency is primarily English-speaking)
- Search for **specific popular EN VTubers** to train the algorithm:
  - `Gawr Gura`
  - `Mori Calliope`
  - `Shoto`
  - `Ironmouse`

### 2. Use YouTube's Built-in Filters (Most Important Step)

After you type your search, **always use the filter menu**.

1.  Perform a search like `EN VTuber`.
2.  Directly below the search bar, click **`Filter`** (フィルタ).
3.  In the **"Subtitles/CC"** (字幕/CC) section, select **`English`**. This tells YouTube you want videos that either have English subtitles or are in English themselves. This is a very powerful filter.

### 3. "Train" Your YouTube Algorithm

This is a long-term solution that will make YouTube JP recommend English VTubers to you automatically.

- **Watch Full Videos:** When you find an English VTuber you like, watch their videos for a substantial amount of time (not just a few seconds).
- **Like and Subscribe:** Actively like (👍) their videos and subscribe to their channel. This is a very strong signal to the algorithm.
- **Use "Not Interested":** If a Japanese VTuber video is recommended to you, click the three dots `...` next to it and select **`Not interested`** (興味なし). You can even select **`Don't recommend channel`** (このチャンネルをおすすめしない) if it's persistent.
- **Clear Watch History (If Needed):** If your watch history is full of Japanese VTuber clips, consider pausing and clearing it from your Google account settings to give the algorithm a "fresh start."

### 4. Advanced Search with Operators

You can use YouTube's search operators directly in the search bar for more precise control.

- **Search in Title:** Use `allintitle:`
  - Example: `allintitle: EN VTuber`
- **Combine with Language:** While you can't directly search `lang:en`, you can combine the title search with an English term.
  - Example: `allintitle: "zatsudan" English` (This might find English VTubers doing a "zatsudan" or free-talk stream).

### Summary & Quick Start Plan

1.  **Immediate Fix:** Search for **`hololive English`** or **`Nijisanji EN`** and then use the **`Filter > Subtitles/CC > English`** option.
2.  **Medium-Term Strategy:** Subscribe to 3-5 English VTuber channels you find. Like a few of their videos. This will immediately shift your recommendations on the homepage.
3.  **Long-Term Solution:** Consistently watch, like, and subscribe to English VTuber content. Use "Not Interested" on Japanese content you don't want to see. Your homepage will eventually become a perfect feed for English VTubers, even on YouTube JP.

By using these methods, especially the **Filter by English subtitles**, you should be able to effectively find and build a feed of English VTubers on the Japanese YouTube site. Happy watching
