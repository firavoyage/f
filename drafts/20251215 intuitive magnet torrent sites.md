the pirate bay alternatives

---

Here’s a list of **sites and services people commonly use as alternatives to The Pirate Bay** (these are mostly torrent directories/indexers — many are blocked in some regions and often host or link to copyrighted material). I’m _not_ encouraging piracy; this is informational and includes a mix of indexing tools and legal options: ([WizCase][1])

#### Popular Torrent Indexes / Trackers

- **1337x** – Large library with movies, TV, games, software, music; often cited as one of the most popular Pirate Bay alternatives. ([Wikipedia][2])
- **LimeTorrents** – Simple interface with many categories; shows torrent health info. ([WizCase][1])
- **Torlock** – Emphasizes verified torrents and rewards reporting of fakes. ([Tenorshare][3])
- **YTS (YIFY)** – Focuses on movies with smaller, high-quality files. ([GoProxy][4])
- **TorrentDownloads / TorrentDownload sites** – Large catalogs including software and Asian content. ([PrivacyRadar][5])
- **Zooqle** – Growing index with many TV shows and movies. ([VPNBrains][6])
- **EZTV** – Good for TV show torrents. ([Techopedia][7])
- **Torrentz2** – Meta-search engine that aggregates results from many sites rather than hosting torrents directly. ([VPNBrains][6])
- **ExtraTorrents** – Extensive library and active community notes. ([Binge Cringe][8])
- **Demonoid** – Long-running, community-driven site with diverse content. ([Tenorshare][3])
- **iDope** – Search engine style torrent index with a tribute to Kickass Torrents. ([Prosyscom Tech][9])
- **GloTorrents** – Interface similar to Pirate Bay and easy searching. ([Pirate Bay Proxy][10])

#### Niche & Community Options

- **Nyaa / NyaaTorrents** – For anime, manga, and related media. ([PrivacyRadar][5])
- **MVGroup** – Focused on documentaries and educational media (still active as a tracker/forum). ([Wikipedia][11])

#### Legal or Safer Alternatives

If your goal is **legal content**, there are also sites that use torrenting for public-domain or freely licensed material:

- **Internet Archive** – Large digital library (movies, books, software) with legal torrent downloads. ([PrivacyRadar][5])
- **Public Domain Torrents** – Torrents of movies in the public domain. ([PrivacyRadar][5])
- **Jamendo** – Creative Commons music platform. ([PrivacyRadar][5])
- **Etree** – Community sharing live music recordings where allowed. ([PrivacyRadar][5])

#### Notes on Safety & Legality

- Many of the torrent indexing sites link to copyrighted material; downloading such content may be **illegal** in your jurisdiction.
- These sites are frequently blocked by ISPs or governments; some people use VPNs, but laws vary widely where you live.
- Torrent sites often have **pop-ups and ads** that can be unsafe — security tools (ad blockers, up-to-date antivirus) help reduce risk.

**Important safety & legality notes**

- Many of these sites host or link to content that may **violate copyright law** where you live. Make sure you understand and follow local regulations.
- Torrent sites are notorious for **ads, pop-ups, and malicious links**; use a good ad blocker and up-to-date security software.
- A VPN can help protect your privacy online, but it doesn’t make illegal downloads legal.

If you’d like, I can also share **legal sites and resources** where you can download free or Creative Commons-licensed media safely.
