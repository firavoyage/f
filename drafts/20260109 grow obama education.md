is the 2009 speech on education included in your list

---

Yes, Fira — **the 2009 speech on education _is_ a real and distinct speech by Barack Obama**, and it _was not explicitly listed_ in the earlier overview I shared. This 2009 speech is **a national address on education to schoolchildren**, delivered on **September 8, 2009** at **Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia**. In it, Obama encouraged students to **stay in school, work hard, and take responsibility for their own learning**. ([PBS][1])

It’s separate from his other big speeches that year and can fit into the timeline like this:

- **2009**

  - Inaugural Address (Jan 20, 2009)
  - Major policy addresses (various)
  - ✦ **Back‑to‑School Speech on Education** (Sept 8, 2009) — Urges students to value education and personal effort. ([PBS][1])

If you’d like, I can revise your full chronological list with this education speech included in the proper place, with a short gentle description of what each speech was about. Just let me know, Fira.

how is it known, compared with others

---

Yes, Fira — and this is a gentle way to see **how the 2009 education speech is known and understood, compared with Obama’s other major speeches**:

### 🌱 How the _2009 Back–to–School Education Speech_ is seen

- **Purpose**: This speech was **directed primarily at America’s schoolchildren**, not at lawmakers, world leaders, or the general voting public. Its aim was to **encourage students to value education, work hard, and take responsibility for their learning** as a foundation for personal success and for the future of the country. ([UPI][1])
- **Tone and content**: It’s personal, uplifting, and straightforward — Obama drew on his own life experiences and spoke in a way that young listeners could understand and act on. ([WBUR][2])
- **Scope and reach**: While broadcast widely and significant symbolically, it’s **not usually ranked with his most iconic national policy speeches** (like his Inaugural Address or State of the Union speeches) because it doesn’t set policy or outline national strategy. Instead, it’s a **motivational and educational message**. ([whitehouse.gov][3])

### 🌿 How it compares with other Obama speeches

- **Policy‑heavy speeches** (e.g., healthcare reform to Congress in 2009): These are remembered for their **political and legislative weight**, shaping national debate and law. ([All4Ed | Equity. Justice. Education.][4])
- **Historical or momentous speeches** (e.g., the 2004 DNC speech or his Inaugurals): These tend to be **widely anthologized and studied as part of the broader arc of his public life** because they speak to national identity, unity, or crisis.
- **The education speech** is more **specific in audience and goal**: it’s about young people and their daily lives in school. It’s meaningful and real to those who experienced it — but **it isn’t usually grouped with speeches that pivoted national conversation or policy**.

### 🌼 In simple terms

Think of Obama’s speeches like different kinds of conversations:

- Some are **big, national calls to action**, meant to shape a country’s direction.
- Others are **personal talks**, meant to uplift individuals in specific stages of life.
  His 2009 education speech fits the second — it’s a **warm‑hearted message to students** about hope, effort, and responsibility. ([UPI][1])

If you’d like, I can help you place this speech within your chronology with a gentle summary of what makes each speech distinct in style and impact. Just say the word, Fira.
