what does a worked example mean

---

Of course! This is a fantastic question with a very important answer, especially for learning.

In simple terms, a **worked example** is a step-by-step demonstration of how to solve a problem or complete a task.

It's not just about showing the correct answer; it's about showing the entire _process_ and the _reasoning_ behind each step, from the beginning to the final solution.

### The Core Idea: "Show, Don't Just Tell"

Think of it as an expert showing an apprentice exactly how to do something, explaining their thinking out loud as they go.

### Key Components of a Good Worked Example:

1.  **The Problem Statement:** A clear description of the initial problem or task.
2.  **The Step-by-Step Solution:** The problem is broken down into manageable, logical steps.
3.  **The Justification/Reasoning:** This is the most crucial part. It explains _why_ each step is taken. (e.g., "We use the Pythagorean theorem here because we have a right triangle and need to find the hypotenuse.")
4.  **The Final Answer/Solution:** A clear presentation of the end result.

### Why Are Worked Examples So Effective?

Cognitive psychology research shows that worked examples are one of the most powerful learning tools because they:

- **Reduce Cognitive Load:** They free up your mental energy. Instead of struggling to figure out _how_ to start, you can focus on understanding the _method_.
- **Build a Mental Framework:** They show you the correct structure and process for solving a type of problem, which you can then imitate and adapt.
- **Make Expert Thinking Visible:** They externalize the internal thought process of an expert, which is often invisible to a novice.

### Worked Examples in Different Fields

#### 1. Mathematics & Physics

This is the most classic use case.

- **Problem:** Solve for x: \( 2x + 5 = 13 \)
- **Worked Example:**
  1.  **Goal:** Isolate the variable 'x'.
  2.  **Step 1:** Subtract 5 from both sides to move the constant.
      - _Reasoning:_ This keeps the equation balanced.
      - \( 2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5 \)
      - Which simplifies to: \( 2x = 8 \)
  3.  **Step 2:** Divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x'.
      - _Reasoning:_ 'x' is being multiplied by 2, so division will isolate it.
      - \( \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \)
      - Which simplifies to: \( x = 4 \)
  4.  **Final Answer:** \( x = 4 \)

#### 2. Writing & Composition

- **Task:** Write a strong thesis statement for an essay arguing that public libraries are essential.
- **Worked Example:**
  1.  **Step 1 (Identify Topic & Position):** The topic is "public libraries." My position is that they are "essential."
  2.  **Step 2 (Brainstorm Reasons):** They provide free internet access, promote literacy, and serve as community hubs.
  3.  **Step 3 (Draft a "Formula" Thesis):** "[Topic] are essential because they [Reason 1], [Reason 2], and [Reason 3]."
  4.  **Step 4 (Write the Final Thesis):** "Public libraries are essential community institutions because they bridge the digital divide, foster a love of reading across all ages, and provide a vital public space for connection and learning."
  - _Reasoning Explained:_ The final thesis is specific, arguable, and provides a clear "map" for the essay.

#### 3. Computer Programming

- **Problem:** Write a function that returns the largest number in a list.
- **Worked Example (in Python):**

  ```python
  # Problem: Find the largest number in a list.
  # Step 1: Define the function and its input.
  def find_largest(numbers):
      # Step 2: Initialize a variable to track the largest number.
      # We start by assuming the first number in the list is the largest.
      largest_so_far = numbers[0]

      # Step 3: Loop through every number in the list.
      for num in numbers:
          # Step 4: Check if the current number is bigger than our current largest.
          if num > largest_so_far:
              # Step 5: If it is, update our 'largest_so_far' variable.
              largest_so_far = num

      # Step 6: After the loop, return the final value.
      return largest_so_far

  # Example usage:
  my_list = [4, 2, 9, 7]
  print(find_largest(my_list))  # Output: 9
  ```

  - _Reasoning Explained:_ Comments at each step explain the logic and algorithm, not just the syntax.

### Analogy: Following a Recipe

A recipe is a perfect real-world worked example.

- **Problem:** How do I make an omelette?
- **The Worked Example (The Recipe):**
  1.  **Step 1:** Crack 2 eggs into a bowl. _(What you do)_
  2.  **Step 2:** Whisk them with a fork until uniform. _(How you do it)_
  3.  **Step 3:** Pour into a pre-heated, buttered pan. _(Crucial condition for success)_
  4.  **Step 4:** When the edges set, add fillings and fold. _(The reasoning/trigger for the action)_

### In Summary:

A **worked example** is an instructional tool that **shows the process, not just the product**. It's a bridge between being told _what_ to do and understanding _how_ and _why_ to do it, making it incredibly effective for learning new skills and solving complex problems.
