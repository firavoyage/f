23 40 see a pack of unopened potato chips on my desk, which stayed for a few days. put it back to the box since i should not be so easy now. put no black tea in the cup of boiled water. pause the video, not willing to finish watching it without a good physical state, which could be a pity of the content and a waste of time.

14 00 take the first french lesson on duolingo inspired by the black guy.

think im not on the right path, being too greedy, wanna use many llms at a time, instead of just using the right one, like asking the next question for starting generation early before reading the current a few days ago, since focusing too much on optimizing details could lead to forgetting the big picture. waste hours comparing llms today (but it's ok anyway).

17 40 try to create an origami of sparkle's mask following chen xiao's vid tutorial, with a 30 square cm paper, a birthday present last year, black tea, classic flavor potato chips, animenz music, and a soft earplug. 22 20

11 40 surf (add mirekintoc, mengxi969, and servalcandle to twitter list f, from the search of zanmiao, found on a comment on a zhihu post about safe telegram usage in cnml). 12 20

13 40 chat: japanese learning textbooks and advice. prompt: continue chat on openrouter. 14 40

15 00 think about economics (naive). 15 40

18 00 switch to double column view in douyin. think: are douyin recommendation the same beyond single (auto play vid) or double column view? what about berryberry? (i will always use berryberry on web and yt-dlp. but berryberry recommendation is full of anime porn...) eat (intentional surfing) eventually?

20 40 chat: taobao refund hack and my philosophy in the greedy unstable world. 21 40

25

00 00 archive chats where gemini 3 pro is really fascinating.

01 40 sleep.

18 20 buy big sausage from family mart, standing in front of the window for a while, like

18 40 receive some packages from taobao. try to play a refund trick with a simple method "你没有保密. 现在我无法得到这个商品. 我编写差评." choosing "not receiving the product" with the reason "dont want it any longer". ask grok and browse some infomation on douyin and comfirm my guess that the logistics interception could fail a lot.

i did not take photograph, because i think wealthy and lucky girls like me could buy a lot of goods, have a lot of delicious food in the future. as i have a project named all: world goods list, i could reflect and visualize as long as i have screenshoted the shopping history. eventually i took photos, since i thought there's something could not be fully inferred, like the lights and the environment, which could bring me back to the precious moments in my life.

even without the support from the outer world, i could have something i want, like the poorly educated factory workers buying an iphone with loan, which i may see philistine.

19 40 download taobao for more info. view the package state (poorly designed, wasting time finding where to go). regret: maybe i should refund after getting the package to make sure i have no loss... see the money refunded for my "good credit" (where i could not).

waste an hour... but how many hours have i wasted? im a tech guy!

20 00 regret. buy the same mygo mortis doll again, assuming the seller could manage to get back the package (i will refund with the package if the previous package arrived.). now i could have no loss despite credit (where the buyer has way more right).

20 40 talk to taobao real human customer service, about how and when could i determine whether i could receive it, which (who) claimed that i could not receive the package, not fully standing on my interest as expected.

26

00 00 find the final answer about the refunding trick. 00 40

10 20 pick up the hobby of practicing english translation for mindfulness.

11 00 try to prove `t<(t-1)/ln(t)<1` without multiplying `ln(t)`. fail whatever using derivative, analysis of the components of the function. learn from the math teacher that `ln(x)` could be the factor while `e^x` could be the divisor for easier derivative.

12 00 have lunch at taco truck.

18 20 buy glazed meatball skewers from family mart.

19 40 refresh myself. try to simplify taobao (like removing distractions) by config (like underaged mode) and fail (not an option available there).

things are normalized when switching to english, which is only available in sane countries, which wont support cny. designed with disrespect to the time of philistines, trying to be with the evil would never succeed at the end of the day.

later i found that in the chinese version of taobao, the "categories" on the dock is replaced by "short videos", enabling doom scrolling while preventing from intentional looking up goods.

20 20 write the final words of taobao refund trick.

mindfulness, the precious thing of mine. way more important. thrill could be found somewhere clean. how did i? cn guys. (here, the hard competition, fooling with censorship, the weird world, to be sane and get to the starting line cost much more. i should have known that.)

22 40 open a can of coca cola. ~~start reading no longer human.~~ take a look on all the biao ri textbooks.

17 00 continue the origami project.

20 20 learn about social events, the causes, the course, and the impact in china. 22 00

30

00 20 continue origami. finish it. feel really tired and relief. 05 00

15 20 try to give it a simple fix and finish the yellow origami bird but give up. 15 40

i thought i have 8 hours until midnight. but idk how to use.

16 20 cock on berryberry.

the frontpage of eat:berryberry could be myself, my perspective (top down, categories), and the overview (sub notifications? boom vids?). instead of a grid of arousing vids (recommendation), wasting my precious attention.

16 40 watch "疑似神秘网红复活 神戳戳的苏神" on berryberry

17 20 play geogebra. think things on math class on friday. write down the thoughts. 18 00

18 00 surf berryberry, bfs from comments under menci's lastest singing vid.

should i create an indie game today. what kind of indie game. i have 5 hours.

what should i do first. what should i do now.

conclusion: a simple sequence. simplify, organize, make, refine, create.

for example, simplify (view and archive chats) first, organize (categorize berryberry fav) next.

duolingo is inspiring and good for meditation. in the day i could go for the curiosity of learning instead of the push to finish an assignment. it could also help me find mindfulness and meaningfulness, when idk what to do and try to start random surfing in the never ending now.

18 40 revise the neutral girl of wisdom prompt. chat: nat. 19 20

it took 2 hours? tell me, journal.

dont waste time revising the girl of wisdom prompt any more. dont fomo. no perfect prompt exists. be sincere. either tell llms everything about myself. either talk directly without any infomation. i may ask for impersonalization specifically using the fira prompt.

22 20 reduce entropy by removing deprecated (obvious meaningless) messages. close previous chats on carte.

i went on the wrong way. if i think, i would evaluate. it is wrong to have only one html, to paste the document inside the message, and to put the prompt template and the specific request together.

15 00 add cookie for ytdlp and retry. add get cookies locally extension. surf berryberry for a while. waste an hour for my obstinateness and perfectionism (wanna hack youtube, not willing to change myself, the ip. struggling between the form of saved files).

whatever method (cookies) failed at anti bot. switching ip worked without cookies.

~~15 20~~ ~~15 40~~ ~~16 00~~ 16 20 learn chemistry with photo solver. complete page 3. 17 00

18 00 put douyin into the archive folder after surfing zhihu, filling the space of idv removed yesterday.

douyin limits the form of contents, which may arouse philistines. sharing observations with geniuses could be way better than making fun of idiots. i may use it to publish stuff. i could surf it, but know that things wont change in the never ending now (the rts games, the tech otaku culture, and the society problems could be almost constant).

idv is boring, full of werid guys, and sometimes not playable (could not make a match up). too much rubbish time in a game.

use zhihu whenever i wanna surf douyin.

19 20 try to complete two pages of chemistry problemset in 20 min while downloading rest vids. skip the obvious easy problems. manage to download after checking ytdlp help. 19 40

timeboxing!

i could choose not to download all the music videos. perfectionism...

20 40 waste an hour for false assumption (there must be a decent music player on ubuntu that supported synced lyrics embeded in mp3). get extremely frustrated and wanna suicide but get much better watching the music vids. 22 00

use mkv with en subs instead. i could have a simple script to get the zh subs. but i realize i love english, informal simple english used in lyrics.

22 00 waste one more hour for trust weird scripts. 23 20

i wont give up. i could pay anything. i dont care law or ethics for what i desire. at the end of the day i got jp zh-hans subs.

ask for float.

11

00 20 chat: essense, mindset and methodology, top down and bottom up. 01 20

22 40 feel a bit uncomfortable and cough. switch to kagura mea, the kawaii and osft voice.

sameko saba arouses too much attention.

waste time for surfing low quality stuff (high assumption, increasing entropy) and low energy (not being mindful).

so much content. everything i appreciate. it... could be rewarding, idk. but is it feasible in time?

12

13 00 have some whole wheat bread. boil water about half of the cup to pour all in later. duolingo. view some indie games on berryberry recommendation. 13 20

sometimes indie game demos of less views would feel better (e.g. in comments), without the hustle and bustle. but i stopped. maybe bfs a vid platform would not be the best way to find inspirations. i could be more intentional.

society. the poor has no choice. most money comes from the gray area. but sometimes the sane ones do not need to be that greedy. they could be free. recall words of the class master xiaojiong "your parents have made enough money. just go anywhere as you like.", similar as zhaohai said. menci, one of the geniuses (i mean luck, the original sin from birth), said "follow your heart". some ordinary guys on hu chenfeng's channel have an idea similar to daoism. great.

really simple. ive pasted the content of config.py inside app.py. i pressed ctrl z. everything is fixed. no need to document everything. llms could surely handle the context.

22 20 carte: art genres, claude monet, "depression".

23 40 journal: screenshot.

25

00 00 watch "二次元毛邓江胡！Mygo 动漫少女代指中国五代领导人的键政密码本" for a while. write some weird thoughts.

01 00 continue watching "Indie Game: The Movie" for 20min. journal: (deprecate) screenshot.

02 00 sleep.

18 00 receive christmas gift: black truffle chocolate. play google santatracker (search christmas for the holidays duration and see a doodle).

delicious. find a bug on presentbounce for models stuck. feel delighted and relaxed, like in a childhood dream, or a fairy tale.

18 40 have oden (from family mart). boil water. continue watching "Indie Game: The Movie". (19 20)

vlc wears a christmas hat on its icon.

19 40 write down some thoughts. 20 00 organize the journal prompts. journal: logo, favicon. (chat: linux cheetsheet, more comprehensive. compare handle with synonyms.) 21 20

slowly, carefully, gently. life is a journey. creation takes time. just, no need to rush.

21 20 see everyone on simplelive and take screenshots. love shizuku lulu.

xu toso is drawing pictures, wearing santa hat, in a weird decorated room. vtubers are singing, in a fantasy world. funshiki is playing a split fiction with his gf (already married). shizuku lulu is creating a retro dream, and sharing real life moments, and expressing personal feelings in a lighted, pink and purple room, sincerely. ace taffy is singing weird songs in the form of a stupid doll. lotus is reading love stories and making satirical criticism.

22 40 download the godfather. watch shizuku lulu in the background.

https://thepiratebay.org/description.php?id=8217881

lulu: what could i do at spare time... prepare for a contest. msc. ive heard foreigns could become civil servants. join a club. what if i meet an otaku... "i hate otaku!!!!!" (idk what some japanese words mean.)

danmaku: go gambling. join a band. dance on a plaza. work for a job. take a class. go cycling or fishing. travel. play with the stock. learn to be a doctor.

23 20 journal: web server. (install flask) 24 00

an extension, idk which, points out i dont have flask (by a lightblue wavy line). isnt flask battery included by default... idk.

26

00 20 carte: game design questions. 01 00 sleep.

18 00 scrcpy: fix adb connection issue for github official version.

18 40 revise the userscript, chatgpt copy, to support long conversations. fail without any progress. 19 40

waste time identifying the problem. i should leverage thinking.

19 40 retry: the userscript fix. 21 00

21 00 lose in thoughts. 22 00

upset. disappointed. resigned. "humans are hopeless." nothing is ideal.

maybe caused by the "chatgpt copy" frustration. pessimistic.

the deeper root (essence) could be the mood or mindset. a bit dizzy. not clear minded (at least in some math problems). a good sleep could help.

doing such things (restarting, copy pasting, retrying, refreshing, waiting and checking, failing) could get me into something bad (frustration, maybe), leading to unwise decisions (behavior).

reflecting. believe science (everything is cause and effect.). i feel a bit calm.

i wont choose to write down my thoughts. (conservative guys, unhelpful community, stupid people) "if i express myself, be sincere and honest, it may not work. i have to deal with the real world." it's not real. real is a positive word. idk.

be a bit gentle. rest well (yeah, maybe i need that, my eyes tend to close now, writing these). idk.

saying "idk" feels good. a girl ive met loves saying that.

23 00 feel better after watching shizuku lulu live replay for a while.

she knows human, really.

23 20 switch to the microsoft account using cookie manager. activate the base style (wisdom) accidentally.

not have things turned off. may be something good?

upd a minute later: the base style, is kind of... weak.

27

00 20 life: time, future, certainty. recall menci's sorrow. see my photos and reflect/remember/recollect. continue chat. download book kokoro. ~~01 00~~ ~~01 20~~ 01 40 sleep.

idk why i happen to download it. right after downloading and comparing between versions.

washing my face, i have some brilliant ideas. for the screenshot flash issue, i could play a magic move: remove animation before screenshot, enable after. (may be inspired by the scrcpy trick)

11 20 go for a meal. idk what. be pushed by the family. 12 00 duolingo with lulu in the background.

i dont have time to even apply my questions to llms, which ive thought on bed.

upd: just some ordinary food. or i ate too fast, perhaps.

the first ep of lulu live replay is not the beginning of live. false assumption of the right order.

sometimes i try to wake up with a few questions and pursuits in mind.

13 00 return. boil water. put on earplug. prepare chocolate. watch lulu for a while. 13 20 scrcpy: forward audio. 14 00

14 20 compress pink floyd for phone. 14 40 read over personal twitter profile and fira's list. 15 00 read ruanyf weekly of the last month. create a new twitter list: fira, the curation over curation.

15 40 get infomation overwhelmed. rest for a while. boil water. wash my face. leverage thinking.

regain mindfulness and grace.

16 20 wake up.

19 20 skim the ruanyf weekly. 20 00 find and get fascinated in larr.net.

most will cease to exist in weeks.

21 40 listen to mygo. find out that some are wrong, the same song by the different singer.

22 00 watch (find) "带着一百万...我们去了论文代写聚集地". download mygo playlists on youtube.

mediastorm uses google, youtube, chatgpt, etc. as norm. good. old money really adds to the world, creating wealth in a proven way. "dont be evil". employing good people, fluent english, calm and confident narration. making and selling goods themselves, neutral clothes, following mr beast. (although running a big company has some limitations itself, compared with lks channel, and chasing views on youtube may cause a bit philistine or entertainment oriented.)

youtube applied its material colors on vid description when expanded.

オリジナル楽曲 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUFFl4hYd1R0hXxp-G6qU9IjaT0uAFSIN

歌ってみた・カバー https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUFFl4hYd1R3DbWVEUf1Nk6LUN8f-yjwX

(deprecated, some unavailable, not by region blocking) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUFFl4hYd1R3ZP_lzxF48iIfjbT0ayxWw

i could process them easily later. and fix the song source issue.

23 00 play https://children-of-god.pdjjq.org/ bfs from ruanyf weekly, issues, a creator's blog. for 10 minutes. open the source and try to find the endings with ai.

28

01 40 watch "Professor Shocks High School by Speaking Gen Z Slang".

youtube sometimes hide save in "...", sometimes not. one could not click the profile (lead to the vid instead of the profile). good for users, bad for geeks.

02 00 watch (find) "What Would You Do with 1 Million? First Destination of the Million Check Series!".

digital nomad. essay helping writer. really creative and inspiring. well educated people... good...

i will watch the god father and the two vids tomorrow!

(download top imdb films from the pirate bay is fast. i could download them anytime, for example, after watching this.)

plan:

carte, game design, possibilties. (decide the game, a clear imagination)

journal. the magic. how to describe the ui. choices about tech stuff. what about the data. the graceful ui (antfu style, maybe).

no need to rush. great.

11 20 breakfast, soy milk and yellow steamed bun, with duolingo and zhihu.

the first zhihu passage is about the mediastorm's essay helping writer vid, a cs student learnt a lot through the homework of top universities, getting paid a little (similar to a builder), in bjydu (student he). a feel of jiang yanyan.

12 40 organize things. create todo. finish zhihu daily digest.

a bit messed up. time to arrange, the next three things to do, for example.

13 20 download some movies picked on imdb. download "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". have lunch after that, jiaozi, sausages, and crab (weird but luxurious).

Fight Club https://thepiratebay.org/description.php?id=7949962

Inception https://thepiratebay.org/description.php?id=7349754

the browser does not work. the down speed of inception got to 7mbps. filled the bandwidth, maybe?

14 20 fix userscript: chatgpt copy, about heading.

til: choose boring tech.

15 00 continue fix mygo: wrong source. 16 00

til: clarity first.

16 00 open "italian red meat flavor". boil water. watch "What Would You Do with 1 Million? First Destination of the Million Check Series!". view some comments on berryberry, 50x views there.

clickbait titles. impact of mr beast. the rise of huai gu. the story of media storm.

17 00 watch "带着一百万...我们去了论文代写聚集地". get frustrated by the weird african language and youtube caption error. spend 20min to create a workaround of download caption and add my own but fail.

choose youtube for the better ui. (google, wealth, high class society.) 30x views on berryberry. although "the value of a first class consumer worths 10x than the rest of the world, incl. chinese", a quote from vtubers. (sc sub is fixed inside the berryberry source... fuck. awkward compliance for the bad platform.)

boil water. take a deep breath. still staying with youtube, the first world. "dont be evil.", a calm statement out of strong confidence of the wealth and wisdom.

mediastorm and low paid workers in kenya both use telegram. good. the benevolence from russia, durov, the geek culture, the aesthetic, the essence of messaging. use samsung phones, another gift.

check berryberry danmaku for a minute. full of nonsense. not a gleam of genius or insight. feelings, praises, jokes/memes, silly slangs, "til!", "that's me, so stupid" "so good man" "impressive". dont trust the low society, as expected.

on the screen of a successful kenya writer (family background, educated, working outside a exploiting platform, reputation): deepseek (for its high free tier limits maybe), windows 11 of the libre world, opera browser (?, ai feature maybe, idk), bundled microsoft apps, whatsapp, vlc, tiktok (android on windows). on the browser (chrome): claude deepseek chatgpt capcut copilot whatsapp wise paypal facebook gmail grammarly sources (news, gov/org sites). core methodology: self learning.

check berryberry subtitle: "broke". as expected. but i... sometimes dont trust myself enough.

berryberry's ui is so stupid. fuck cn ml. a big button for "report the vid" "take a note". a danmaku list on the right (it's, stats for nerds! just putting all features requested by pm, right? no data driven dev like google, where you could see few viewers click it. no support, e.g. money, to make these good things happen. i think maybe the web ui is deprecated somehow, coz only 1/10 viewers here.).

choose berryberry at the end of the day (the awkward english, cacuminal). neither remove nor notice the distractions on the awful ui. full screen. with philistine danmakus closed. essence/metaphor: the way of living in china, where fira would be.

"passion? generally writing, not academic writing per se. yeah, ~. coz... i mean, i consider myself a land historian, like unemployed professor of history. ... better scripts, better history scripts, better political scripts, and better travel vlogs and blogs. i have to be a reader and a writer. ... assuming you re getting paid to learn a skill. that's like two birds with one stone again."

"gov hopes everyone could get educated in universities. but there are no enough jobs." "unemployment." check danmaku for a sec: "what do you mean? nobody could say a word, ok then, i will also appear to be redacted."

in a word, high gini coefficient.

18 40 chat: geography, gini around the world.

19 00 finish watching the kenya short film by mediastorm. view the comments on youtube "the best of both worlds".

good direction. some strategies applied. like zooming into a face and fading into another, like revealing the real identity of someone at the end.

well, it's about to go into a new year. and im still getting gravitated to society irl, comparing the situations of humanity. would the world leaders, e.g. openai/cursor workers have these boring thoughts? definitely not. they dont even know. there are a lot of people who live a sane life. about the ones succeeded in competitions... they could know. maybe they will think and believe/agree with something similar. and they wont get angry. because, they are the happy few, right? fira... about fira, i think fira is one of them, at least materially. in the real life it's ok to feel a bit frustrated or upset on something. take a deep breath. be wise. be graceful.

22 00 prepare tea. write another letter to myself, cc to the family. choose to send an email. 23 40

recall: a letter to myself, about schooling (cc to the class master, but she did not notice / have time to read, maybe).

23 40 watch "Fight Club", for an hour.

i think i could follow my plan. fira, you love that, right?

late night. a sanctuary of self.

29

01 00 sleep.

so much for today. have a nice day.

18 20 write some thoughts on mygo characters. boil water. watch "Fight Club" from 1 hour. open a pack of classic flavor. 20 00.

20 20 organize things on the phone. create app preview. add support to html for vscode code runner. (20 40)

"Gemini one shotted this."

22 20 surf zhihu: society, economics (america irl, r/homeless). 23 00

23 00 play pink floyd at max volume. hit hard my right knee with my fist. get extremely high. (may be caused by the zhihu, but i like that. jesus christ.) browse before closing some twitter tabs. 24 00

turn the emperor xi down! fuck off yellow guys, let white/black on! let barrack obama be the next president!

recall the political memes in the toilet in my school. that's youth. that's the infinite momentum of tomorrow.

some mtfs. idk why i added to the fira "curation over curation" list. because they are weak? make me feel good? anyway, if i like i could remove them later.

30

00 40 read: describe ui to an llm. sleep.

18 20 refresh.

19 00 chat: llms censorship ethics.

the world is what it is.

20 20 switch from pink floyd to shizuku lulu.

20 40 surf youtube. download "The Stranger". appreciate the spirit of "撕毁中國護照，偷渡到美國，大罵中國人都是蛆的「潤人」王偉恆，現在過得怎麼樣了？". 21 40

bfs... too random. get gravitated by random things, like a danmaku "Kill the One from Shijiazhuang". a recommended vid. a comment. something like these. a bit stupid maybe. or just, this time, it's a bit boring. generally i think that curiosity helps overall.

22 40 watch shizuku ruru chatting for a while. feel connected. feel real. feel alive.

i could stay within that fantasy dream for a little longer, without dying for freedom in usa, meeting and exchanging observations with black lives.

black lives doesnt matter. no one matters in the world. we are god's unwanted children. so be it!

31

00 40 twitter daily digest.

14 00 talk with youth after school, a japanese learner abroad with n1 cert, some grade 1 students on pe class (some boys playing badminton, a fat girl, curious, and easygoing)

wont see the japanese learner "zhiyuan" again, maybe. no sns handle given "if we have the fate, we would find each other someday!". although she's active on douyin.

"could you access 91" "what's 91, i mean the url" "show pornhub.com" (no https?! proceed. but idk why.)

(they are surprised about that. while political memes, unixporn/mtf/suicide culture are not as arousing, at least for them.)

"usually i prefer premium contents on bitmagnet more."

the girl knows a lot about life abroad. (relatives, friends, or maybe herself...)

youth... so good man. yokatta...

14 40 go home. see some low paid workers, incl. a deliver and a painter, being peaceful and unhurried. feel at a loss, a bit (why could they feel easy. they should be injured by working and hungry all the time.) express the desire of dying in developed countries.

just go inside. dont care anything.

16 20 organize things on phone. move tabs to laptop. find memories on the legacy folder of the removed smartisan notes app. fall asleep.

23 20 float: appreciate songs.

02

00 20 life: psychology.

considered 01 (at least on file names), since it's when the idea on telegram inner monologue chat is.

01 40 sleep.

12 40 organize todo, things, scratch pad, and journal breadcrumbs. finish quick ones (e.g. organize `all`).

13 00 surf youtube. watch "逆天！户晨风大半夜指挥“半个亿”跑马拉松，最后在直播间立正鞠躬道歉：对不起，我错了！每晚高强度直播，户子胸口痛准备去体检，自称买了很多保险，弹幕：有康复风险吗....".

for the wealthy guy, that money does not even matter. for hu chenfeng, whether buying an insurance is just a personal choice about rish control, and either is reasonable. about the revenue of the insurance company or the negative expectation, that's not a concern. nothing special. a gambler would lose all, not because the expectation is negative, but even if it's positive, he wont manage to win with something thoughtful (practical wisdom).

13 40 categorize readme/personas.

14 00 open a pack of truffles.

200g, without small pack. idk.

clever recommendation... (also seen on twitter. is spring uee that famous?)

11 20 play the last twenty minutes of "【New Year】count down & 2026 plans! | VTuber Cyan" and surf twitter list fira.

15 00 try to convert pdfs to something readable but give up after feasibility check.

19 40 surf twitter. feel cool.

in simplified chinese many are thinking about wealth, about classes, etc. some may even show off going abroad and getting free. they dont. resources are infinite. just buy anything, have anything, and take anything. tokens are free. dont care how many thousands of dollar spent, just keep llms running, and working for me. that's it.

22 40 play douyin for a while. 23 00

I could almost guess what I will recommend. Lives, tech otaku, anime gadgets, light novels, cr, society memes, and popular or promoted ones. Stupid. Nothing special, nothing new.

choose a quiet but general question about it. write for the future self/readers, not the engagement.

07

15 00 run out of battery for surfing/organizing too much telegram (nekogram), more than 1h. ~~learn geography~~ think, plan, and design today's work on notebook instead.

01 00 push to github directly. deprecate the gitee mirror workaround.

09 00 Read light novel, about a fulfilling life. Geography unit 1. About to chat about literature writing style, to make vibe coding graceful.

11 40 Try to switch to Firefox.

As chrome is weird: Close new tab. Show a notification for a few sec. Could not be closed. Covering the chatgpt input bar. And it does not work well without google play. No history.

Android oom after installation. fixed automatically without a complete reboot.

ublock origin added. Good. (using a recent apk on uptodown, not xapk or cnml ver.)

Reg Mozilla acc for sync.

Everything works well. Clicking a button has effect. No need to long press or hover, etc.

12 40 DFS settings (simplify) and enable tab bar.

Firefox is a bit geek styled, less ux, e.g. open new tab button, preview tab, popups. And no download webpage.

A polished consistent app that doesn't work is nothing.

15 00 try to completely turn off notification to remove distracting missed calls.

just play music on the app.

One more mindful interaction is way better than distractions.

16 20 Search to know about navidrome and get redirected to a blocking page runned by CN gov. Fuck ccp. Enable doh by cloudflare. Done.

19 20 assess vertical tab bar. change "Vertical Tabs in Side Panel" shortcut from alt v to ctrl b. disable safe component remover userscript (delete dom elements, may cause render issues) 19 40 forget horizontal or vertical. prefer boring tech. use fullscreen when needed.

it's for wide screen. and it does not remove the complexity of a lot of tabs.

20 20 check innei.in state. see cursor on lobe chat (another chatgpt wrapper project), discord, and linear.

get driven by curiosity. evaluate lobe chat. check discord. learn from linear.

09

01 40 happen to read wave crest "浪潮之巅" and quickly abandon.

i dont need to be that big. be easy.

10 00 chat. lack clarity/specificity. think.

I must be clearer and more rigorous in case mediocrity of llms happens. To humility: maybe one more layer could work. For now, just go fast, learn by doing, test, and retry.

Use specific method as long as it works, get general with abstraction when needed.

14 40 find missed calls notification existing.

Missed calls is not affect by notification settings (fully turned off). Maybe uninstallation would help.

17 20 think about desiderata/mission of fira. clarify. ground.

Make tools elegant: make every existing useful tools elegant in my way.

Make knowledge pure: organize the world of information and make it universally accessible.

12 20 appreciate `白非立上进记（后记）`.

spend time on it. a few hours. idk what im doing. not following the plan. browse more, not close the stalled. but maybe it's worth. ok then go fast and there's no time for bullshit.

12 40 fix network. fix clash verge. 13 00

everything happened to be "too long to respond". idk. try switching wifi not worked (suspicious, few wifi networks, noticable more time to connect than usual).

suspend the laptop. it could not wake up... (isnt it sleep?) restart by long press the power button.

no proxy node. connection failed. idk.

not able to disable system proxy `connection failed`. exit.

not willing to switch back to v2raya. (although it works)

github and flathub could directly connect?!

try clash for windows. fail. try reinstall.

(could not find it in softwares, whether ubuntu or flatpak. apt help. thanks, the deb is kept somewhere decent. give the deb. apt recommends me to use the word. `clash-verge` as expected. remove. install. done.)

worked, without extra config. (maybe things are kept)

notice: from service mode to user mode.

13 40 download `POCKET PARK`. spill some cola on the lifesize pillow (false assumption: the liquid are inside the botton... no wonder why two plastic bags are covering...).

these galgames are not likely to be played.

idk. a bit boring and empty. a bit inspiring. maybe i could make better use of the time. but i dont need to rush or chase something. so, be ok with it.

22 00 read on wenku 8 "Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle", book 1, about chapter 2 and 3 in pink floyd. 23 00

feel bright and satisfied. that's what japanese youth would be. although having momentum filled up, a bit tired now... have a sound sleep! (the sleep metaphor appears in many anime ed...)

11

09 40 have breakfast. surf zhihu. browse "邱占萱 学而思". 10 20

10 40 think about browser tabs.

firefox have vertical one. but firefox itself sucks on ux somewhat. firefox on android is just a pragmatic compromise. chromium have ctrl shift a. but it sucks.

move tabs to a vscode file. named properly. well organized. open one at a time.

a few more intentional steps could be better than unconscious distractions.

11 40 create new tab override extension.

12 00 prompt: remove phatic language.

16 20 have all apks, screenshots, dcim exported. factory reset the phone.

“It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.”

18 40 finish almost everything about the phone.

spend time on removing future distractions. (notifications, missed calls, stubborn apps)

20 40 login to apps. organize phone screen.

feel peaceful.

21 00 organize telegram (ayugram). 22 20

Maybe telegram is not somewhere information rich.

Telegram is not Twitter. That's the point. I couldn't surf telegram. High friction. So I wasted 1h20min organizing.

Keep less than 20 chats? Read once a month?

My purpose is... See everyone. And get inspired.

at last i just put more into archive. it's clear that i should not use telegram directly if i see it as twitter.

takeaway/til:

~~check it weekly.~~ ~~check it for wasting time.~~

_dont iterate unread messages. always jump to bottom._

_surf it as you like, but dont spend too much time on it, less than 10min a session._

feel peaceful but a bit regretful. feel better after writing the takeaway.

12

00 00 life: vite, the trendy mindset.

til: sometimes i could only feel something wrong after entering the question. just clarify it. dont care too much. go ahead.

20 40 driven by curiosity, download and try hellotalk. try soul app and discord.

have fun. connect with people. share ideas.

chat to real humans on telegram and discord with common groups and love of dev.

chat for a few minutes with a guy recommended by discord `c0de_sw0rd`. (mutual servers: project trans, midjourney)

til: too curious. drifting. dont waste an hour of high energy.

13

19 00 do market research: manus. share my ~~stupid~~ ideas.

19 40 sync tabs from mobile playing `【Singing】林俊傑歌回 JJ Lin with guitar`.

til: dont open too much tabs. if something is useless, close it. accept some waste.

20 20 fix firefox duplicate devices (factory reset) by changing password to force sign out.

refer to official help... weird.

22 20 download `kessoku band`, workaround, and normalize. check and fix typos in `drafts`.

14

09 40 Finish reading `Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle` book 1 chapter 2.

count from chapter 0, the preface from now on.

10 40 Surf zhihu and Twitter.

Mindful. Good.

17 20 Finish surfing Twitter (List Fira).

Not surfing for 4 or 5 days. Maybe fomo. But get inspired. Result: screenshots, retweets.

18 00 refresh.

18 40 chat: life, mindset, feeling. intention: feasibility check of auto focusing.

20 00 change the push daily time from `22:00` to `23:40`.

21 40 surf zhihu. read a hard working chinese achieving his american dream.

22 20 cock. gain more momentum.

23 20 feel empty. wanna close my eyes. sleep?

15

01 00 sleep.

08 20 Finish reading `my youth romantic comedy is wrong, as i expected` book 1 chapter 2.

11 40 find something accidentally.

long press url in firefox to copy, unlike chrome.

12 00 have lunch alone.

18 20 refresh.

19 00 chat: fate, luck. open a pack of italian red meat flavor.

19 40 intention: fix closing last tab. feat support incognito. chatgpt: Error in message stream.

20 20 play manifold.markets.

21 00 write about the family.

22 40 browse wengtianxin and extraordinary (from innei).

23 00 watch `High School Dropout to OpenAI Researcher - Gabriel Petersson Interview (Extraordinary)` for a few secs.

abandoned.

i want to be wise and graceful, which implies quiet and peaceful, without showmanship, without hustle and bustle. the film is noisy. i would like to sleep soundly before dying.

btw, ive found this before: i dont need a lot of meta thinking methodologies.

make me more energetic. so good.

23 00 appreciate `An old mans advice.`.

feel cozy.

23 00 play `【Art Study】More Yuri Art... | VTuber Cyan` (20 watching now). surf twitter.

best of today: cursor created a new browser by running gpt 5.2 for a week.

16

17 20 refresh.

18 00 organize things. telegram. innocent wisdom legacy. humility.

19 40 surf zhihu. write some calm and simple thoughts against "america killing line" on zhihu.

20 40 look up firefox mobile uncontrollable upward scrolling about ten secs after switching foreground app issue.

search bai ling xiao hao at first, when i wake up i happen to think that... maybe i want to see the wealth. what would the happy few be doing in the real world... he does not do anything besides creating stupid vids. poor boy...

btw, later i realize that sometimes i have a dream of giving these wanderers some money. i always dream that recently. i will gift them a second hand laptop with arch linux installed, maimaidx coins, etc. digital space is free, as in freedom. (chi bi fu: qin feng min yue)

i will tell them "i have a small device in my pocket that provides access to nearly the sum total of human knowledge. i use it to get into pointless arguments with people i don't know and look at pictures of cats".

i will guide them into z library, bitmagnet, ytdlp, chatgpt, telegram, twitter, google, wikipedia, the internet archive, github, etc. all movies, music, books, knowledge, and inspirations, are given free to the humanity. you could use them.

hours later i realize the dream, is a dream originated from hu chenfeng, incl. parody accs. i want to ~~show off the wealthy class to~~ express self. or maybe just to broadcast the (otaku/geek/nerd/etc.) culture i love, instead of helping the poor. the world is the world itself, dont help other people. dont try to change someone.

and about hu chenfeng... twitter mention? or youtube/berryberry recommendation. the world is connected. so eventually i will find you someday, as long as i surf/browse(bfs).

til: maybe i could use less than 40 min browsing anything (in grade 10 summer holidays, i spent tens maybe hundreds of hours browsing almost the complete ruanyf archive. weeks before i organize things across phone, laptop, and git remote. days before i browse innei and himself65 archive. everyday i surf telegram and twitter.). spending hours on peaceful lifestyle? maybe not worth it. although i could not really chase anything (try do some work, which turn out useless).

11 40 play matrix67 itch. browse for a while.

i will let them play games: ALMOST INFINITE by matrix67 (IMO2010P5). "8 numbers, 4 on each line, each two lines have no more than 2 duplicates, how many lines" by fira.

13 40 bet on manifold @Fira.

inspired by one previous ruanyf weekly.

14 00 have lunch. ~~clarify the idea of humility.~~

idk how could i compete with claude code, the giant, the infinite wealth gathered. but i pass the feasibility check. sometimes, proving something does not mean i could construct one, maybe that's the point. but i will try.

15 40 write about education, referencing in pure project readme.

23 20 sit on the sofa in the living room.

feel cozy, somewhat more focused. but no desk... i use it as laptop, and.. the screen is shaking... warau.

23 40 return to bedroom (study) due to the noise and awful family.

18

01 00 reflect. sleep.

too much random surfing. pointless market research with a fomo mindset. working around unrelated tools. working when empty, even in heavy noise.

til: leverage thinking. rest well. in solitude humans create.

08 40 organize zshrc.

now i add the time (only hour) to the filename. hope it could add, providing more for reflection without adding much complexity/verbosity.

upd: weird. add 20 min based minutes so it feels better.

09 20 watch youtube vids about claude code. play with "make me a million dollar saas. dont make mistakes." on opencode.

09 40 watch "网友被大幅降薪，表情让户晨风笑出声，得知真相后当场致歉！加拿大网友反向拷打户子，查户晨风的户口；担心女友变强被甩，小伙子够实诚的，实在是忍俊不禁了！".

10 00 generate and read opencode architecture document.

~~todo: get something (e.g. the api) out of opencode.~~

api keys for free models are not public. and free ones are almost useless.

18 00 humility: pet a dog.

waste hours. lack clarity. trust llms too much. escape from leveraging thinking myself.

21 40 create github organization: whathumilityis.

god bless you. god bless humility.

22 40 try claude code router. create api key on openrouter with 1 dollar credit limit.

23 00 ask claude code "create a telegram copy.". work. try with opencode.

similar.

19

08 40 Surf zhihu (see favorites). Play cr. Play chess.

09 20 surf zhihu and get lost. feel excited (and confused, maybe).

政治派系，睡眠。先睡觉。遇到困难睡觉。明天继续，或许。

09 40 (try to) read opencode docs.

"Easy. Inevitable."

upd: spend about 2 hours in the evening instead. escaping, but maybe it's a good choice to avoid reading on the phone. (boring. chatting is more interactive and so, playful)

10 20 surf on telegram.

https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Sparxie

15 40 Learn chemistry

16 20 Finish reading `Too Many Losing Heroines!` book 1 chapter 0 and 1.

18 40 read opencode docs fast.

19 00 browse hn with opencode.

20

00 40 dive into (maybe drift across) the backend tech stack for realities. fix git push script: go to home folder.

maybe the dog and the fetcher will be deprecated a day later: reinventing wheels.

01 20 check feasibility: chatgpt browser automation. succeed.

`message.innertext` `button.click`

all llms are using contenteditable. idk. maybe more flexible.

10 40 Play cr.

13 20 surf twitter.

liuran argues against chinese birth rate with aggressive words. why so serious.

20 00 play phigros. 21 00

maimai dx collection. feel soft, sweet, kawaii, stylish.

21

10 00 change default fold level from 2 to 5.

@ext:felicio.vscode-fold Fold: Level Default fold level

Once a text document is opened, this extension will automatically fold all indented lines to the default fold.level set in User Settings.

a small step removes a lot of future friction.

upd 2026.01.24: to 7. (100 works like 2, idk.)

10 40 remove redundant userscripts

```
Allow Copy and Context Menu Continued

14 40 duo. surf douyin. 15 20

unixporn, fantasy irl, weird/meme.

17 00 wake up from sound sleep.

hugging the lifesize pillow, tightly. arms. knees. face. physical touch. cozy and timelessness.

open the curtains. outside the windows. the sun is ending. tall buildings, warm, maybe hot reflection. sky, blue, pink, sorrow, and dream like. trees in gentle wind. solitude. natural sounds. birds idk. beautiful.

17 20 switch to mobile hotspot.

sometimes i could not connect to the router reliably. sometimes the router could not access the outer world. sometimes the proxy node does not work. allow everything to happen.

21 00 watch shizuku lulu live.

taobao chinese new year stuff. legacy gifts.

watch vids together: travelling across china... the northest villiage next to russia (), shanghai lu one dapuqiao (). and more. even weird news channels.

born here, devoted here, a life dulled here. toxic traditions feeling comfortable. wild countryside with seeming peace. horrible silence. noise buried in the history of humanities. a pond of still water.

dont fall asleep unconsciously in the ever lasting night.

(upd: "Do not go gentle into that good night")

remember durov's word: this year, i wish you less.

mashiro kanon is playing a weird tiny japanese game "click agree", the one played by yuuki sakuna (days?) before.

23 40 watch shizuku lulu live.

japanese luxious highway. wealthy and peaceful life "lifestyle". seven stars.

22

00 00 sleep.

14 20 remove ZaynHao from twitter list fira.

promotional noise. "build in public".

16 40 browse some sota ai researchers of chinese origin. reflect on myself.

at the beginning, fira is not about to add. but to reduce.

- make tools elegant: reduce friction
- make knowledge pure: reduce entropy

btw, many projects of fira has dmca and tos breaking features in mind.

fira wanna be in the form of low energy and sleep quietly in the nature.

17 20 see podwise summary of `翁家翌：OpenAI，GPT，强化学习，Infra，后训练，天授，tuixue，开源，CMU，清华｜WhynotTV Podcast #4`.

independent thinking. determinism.

- 搭建强化学习基础设施比改进强化学习算法本身，更能推动人工智能研究的进展，因为前者能提高实验迭代速度和 infra 的正确性。
- 在大模型研发中，快速修复基础设施中的 bug 是提升模型训练效果的关键因素。
- 计算机领域，代码项目的一致性比参与人数更重要，多人协作可能因假设和沟通不畅导致代码腐化和膨胀。
- 个人对社会产生的影响力，比传统评价体系（如 GPA）更能带来长久的满足感。
- 即使身处现有评价体系的顶端，也应该警惕并挣脱其束缚，为自己建立独特的价值标准。
- 预测未来的能力如果被人工智能掌握，对个人而言可能是一场灾难，因为这会导致所有价值体系的崩塌。
- OpenAI 内部认为，实现通用人工智能（AGI）的关键在于执行力，而非技术本身。
- OpenAI 成功的关键在于极高人才密度的小团队，以及对平庸表现的零容忍。
- 即使在 OpenAI 内部，对技术细节的过度保密和组织架构的臃肿，也会降低迭代速度，从而影响其在 AI 模型领域的领先地位。
- OpenAI 的 "开放" 更多体现在以尽可能低的价格，让普通用户更容易接触到 AI 技术，而非开源核心技术。

podwise is a bit philistine. stupid icons. too much elements on one screen. low info/noise rate (explaining trivial keywords like company and university names).

18 00 hear beautiful piano from neighbours. play `【Singing】Maroon 5 ONLY Karaoke! [q4qFm26Ub3s]`. receive a pack of truffles "truffettes de france", 400g this time.

wanna watch a film in the evening.

18 20 close dify from tabs.

more structure, less intelligence.

does not feel right... no elegance. e.g. in the ui design. native chinese style: complex, working, low leverage, not polished (consistency), hard to breathe.

it's about being user friendly (e.g. scratch.mit.edu). and with ai? who are the users...

the same for "no code platforms".

18 40 refresh.

21 40 watch `Cursor Agent: 10 Pro Tips!`.

seems there's no real autonomy workflows now. pasting error messages... why not auto run and test by default?

what the hell youtube puts recommended vids before comments.

22 40 watch `The Good, the Bad and the Ugly` to 38:16. sleep. 23 20

come back when clear tomorrow.

23

09 40 go school at 10.

Skip two Chinese classes in the morning. Sleepy.

Take the left 2 English classes in the morning and 3 math classes in the afternoon.

12 00 wonder about humility's autonomy possibilities.

Censored. Workaround: hobbies of humans within internet. tech savvy/otaku/geek/nerd hobbies. Easy to do. Example: software engineering, incl. Yc hn, docs. But what else.

Upd: map to r slash

Idk. What I want: leverage free resources, make sense: checkpoints, a certain set of values. White list is enough.

Specify: software engineering. Create existing apps. Notes, tracking, learning, lifestyle, etc. Not infra like browsers and libraries.

12 20 have lunch: Wagas. Beef. Mashed potato. Sukiyaki.

13 00 hear something about sp uee math.

Xiaojiong: objective problems too hard. Big problems might be fake. Gifting pts for free. Less diversity.

16 00 continue watching `The Good, the Bad and the Ugly`. 18 40

19 20 change the naming style of files in drafts.

time: hourly precision. minute will always be 00.

19 20 read leerob in cyan nyan karaoke.

22 00 pick spring uee major favorites: 2 majors from usst.

known that:

- you could only pick 2 majors.
- it's not a must for me to pass sp uee to skip classes in the next term. i can quit school at any time. but whether i go school or not, things wont change.
- given free time, i could not manage to get anything done. too stupid strategy.
- schooling or not does not matter. nothing matters.
- i have inherited wealth. i dont want to do any work. so there are no jobs in the world. i only want to sleep.

im not sure i could get into usst. but other majors are too easy to have in uee.

about the decision:

- i will regret if i get to a bad university wasting my pts, given that three months of free time wont matter. i would better just quit (see himself65). there are many wealthy guys sleeping at home, claiming something like depression.
- simpler, usst feels like something. bad universities (e.g. less than standard 1) are nothing, regardless.

that's it.

btw, i want to try some simple and low paid jobs, in a low energy lifestyle.

23 20 feel empty and even sick (headache).

i will get better tomorrow.

24

12 00 organize zhihu fav: ref.

see, reflect, and browse a bit. some old insights touch me again.

17 00 feel foggy (body). feel stuck (complexity). cr, zhihu, douyin. twitter.

idk how to create an agent. flexible or constraint? abstraction first. (inevitable). read docs could relieve stress. sit cozy on the sofa in the living room. wide. free. relaxed.

reflect:

too excited with something works. too depressed and frustrated when not. foggy when unsciously escaping at first.

18 00 finish twitter digest. review all personal retweets and remove some. 19 00

reflection within the real world.

23 20 sleep.

feel empty (healthy headache).

25

12 00 organize things inside `firavoyage/f`.

15 00 watch some gaozixiang vids. play cr.

easy wins.

16 00 appreciate `What a Low ELO Player Thinks About`.

essential. why not default?

26

18 00 create some github organizations.

`firathejesuschrist` `firathecreation` `firathecreator`

18 20 register linkedin acc for viewing menci.

dfs from github homepage - issues i created - menci/menci - under reconstruction ...

18 40 ~~browse menci linkedin.~~ browse cyan nyan telegram group. feel fun (weird).

Because Cyan posted on her X.
```

19 00 refresh.

19 40 update simplelive.

github releases not available (maybe due to dmca). but action works, even in the official repo. (i assume it simply wont offer something ready to install before and i dont wanna build myself.)

fix some issues (mostly from platform backend updates, e.g. huya stream disconnection, danmaku failed to fetch, no infomation in categories).

show how long the live lasts.

23 00 move boardgame records from f/memories to f/blogging:favorites/boardgames.

23 20 browse maigolabs.

```
アマオケ
FOSS 1.0.4

browse means dfs by default. (browse is simpler. a simple word carries a deep and clear/rigorous meaning. that's best.)

27

02 00 sleep.

too much wandering. stay up for doing something meaningful today.

09 00 wake up?

11 00 get up. choose to quit school.

feel solitude. feel free. feel peace of mind.

13 00 drink boiled water (instead of black tea).

16 00 remove fold extension.

it does not add "fold" feature. it just folds by default. nonsense.

23 20 reg github organization `firahq`.

23 40 watch `Agent Skills, Rules, Subagents: Explained!`.

28

17 20 fail to add latent space podcast to antennapod.

(network? idk)

maybe i dont need it though. but why cant i.

error in rss xml. idk.

hn: "Unfortunately, Latent Space is not RSS friendly"

browse hn. worked. but not well (not just podcast)... where's the lastest one?

"Ask HN: Which sources cover AI developments without falling for the hype?"

workaround: use podwise rss source.

14 40 reg linear: firahq.

beautiful design!

15 00 watch `Her (2013)`. 17 20

19 20 create grow folder. put some ready to print notes inside.

"do things that dont scale".

20 00 toggle lichess ui, willing to make it more chess.com like.

no exact pieces. but could be similar. background from brown to green. the queen and the king position is different (upd: cause: flip board is not just horizontal. imagine you are playing black.). weird.

> chesscom has staff responsible for designing page UI together with a decent number of salaried front end programmers to implement that vision.
>
> lichess has no UI designers, no graphics people, and exactly one salaried staff engineer who is also responsible for data center admin, keeping things running, making sure lichess isn't DDoSed into oblivion, and approving most of the pull requests on about 12 different repos. aside from thibault, we rely on volunteers for graphics and engineering. volunteers donate an hour here and thirty minutes there, 5 hours per week tops.
>
> i'd say the UI is pretty good considering.

22 00 watch simplelive, cr, go.

follow some popular streamers today (with link rev engineered from douyin).

17 20 reg linkedin `firahq`. change twitter handle to `firahq`. reg `firahq` on arxiv, zenoob ~~, osf~~. update readme.

ive heard the dream of "independent researcher" on zhihu, living an ordinary life and publishing some studies at leisure.

upd in the early morning next day: twitter search does not update with the handle change!

18 40 refresh.

22 40 play cr. try to achieve 12 wins but fail.

i dont wanna speak/write a lot in the open ended questions. i dont even know how much should i write. idk. and im not gonna express myself in the boring questions.

"no thanks". (forever loading)

no correct answers shown at last.

15 00 reg new duolingo acc using gmail.

add a stupid 30 pts jp badge to linkedin. start from section 4. (skip the last ... oh i were already on section 5! jump to s5 u23.)

seems duolingo web has some scrolling issues of my screen size (jumping back when attempting to scroll, redundant scroll bars), "responsive web design".

duolingo does not fight the ad blocker, placing an donation cta at the place instead.

beautiful animation.

add courses: jp, en, la, fr, de. (music, chess?).

i dont want greek. ugly, insane.

no avatar/extra config now! simplicity wins.

seems duolingo web is different from my modded android app. (e.g. first course of fr: order at a cafe vs. use basic phrases). upd: confirmed. number of courses differs (due to res version maybe).

set handle `firahq`.

add browser extension "duolingo max" `apersongithub/Duolingo-Unlimited-Hearts`.

15 00 fix metro app thumbnails.

Metro assume songs from the same album should have the same cover art, ignoring what the file is. Holyshit.

Vlc... Worse. It's designed for robustness instead of ux.

Even worse, the data of metro is cached.

Try to delete thumbnail hidden folder under music

Observation: set different album names foo bar. Art applies.

Fix magically. Toggle a few settings. Idk. Thumbnails folder is irrelevant.

Find cause: toggle settings - images - ignore media store covers off and on. Seems the deeper cause is the app is imperative instead of declarative. It's not pure. 

If everything is a state, toggling off and on should behave the exact same.

When I open an album of 200 songs of high quality art... It gets stuck for a sec. Wtf.

18 00 have a haircut.

where i have membership is closed temporarily due to vacation.

the shop on the opposite side would cost 100 cny. quite affordable. but with that money i would likely to have some style and service, which im not intended to.

be simple. if simplicity is not feasible, kill myself.

less is better. that's an universal law. less friction. less hype. less hope. less population, i.e. to not be born, to not give birth, to suicide. shorter life. fewer moves to play. fewer steps to solve a problem.

im not willing to have hair. bypass warnings. ignore suggestions.

the feeling of self appreciation is reserved, even conservative. it could be hypocritical, so fragile. peace wont come from ignorance. and being willing for recognition is nothing.

i go to a small shop to enforce my purpose. a house without any decoration. an old barber. he no longer remembers me, which he would when i were a pupil.

15 40 install `golaxy`. reinstall `com.smartisanos.securitycenter` from canta.

without this, it forces an os refresh (like log out log in on ubuntu) whenever i install an app. maybe that's why sndcpy fails before.

16 00 reg `firahq` on golaxy with 5sim since the prev acc has too low initial rating.

use ca, 6728988269 with 0.19 usd.

btw, 5sim crashes chromium, `SIGSEGV`. firefox works.

the app is buggy. poor i18n (`united kiongdom`, text overflow, mixed languages, weird translation). poor responsive design (not resizable on web, text too small). inconsistent ui (no design system).

well, it's still better than foxwq as it's simple and clear.

maybe there's no well designed go platforms. modern swe frontend. polished sophisticated ui. public profile. sharable game permalink. foss engine. export.
