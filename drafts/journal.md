23 40 see a pack of unopened potato chips on my desk, which stayed for a few days. put it back to the box since i should not be so easy now. put no black tea in the cup of boiled water. pause the video, not willing to finish watching it without a good physical state, which could be a pity of the content and a waste of time.

14 00 take the first french lesson on duolingo inspired by the black guy.

think im not on the right path, being too greedy, wanna use many llms at a time, instead of just using the right one, like asking the next question for starting generation early before reading the current a few days ago, since focusing too much on optimizing details could lead to forgetting the big picture. waste hours comparing llms today (but it's ok anyway).

17 40 try to create an origami of sparkle's mask following chen xiao's vid tutorial, with a 30 square cm paper, a birthday present last year, black tea, classic flavor potato chips, animenz music, and a soft earplug. 22 20

11 40 surf (add mirekintoc, mengxi969, and servalcandle to twitter list f, from the search of zanmiao, found on a comment on a zhihu post about safe telegram usage in cnml). 12 20

13 40 chat: japanese learning textbooks and advice. prompt: continue chat on openrouter. 14 40

15 00 think about economics (naive). 15 40

18 00 switch to double column view in douyin. think: are douyin recommendation the same beyond single (auto play vid) or double column view? what about berryberry? (i will always use berryberry on web and yt-dlp. but berryberry recommendation is full of anime porn...) eat (intentional surfing) eventually?

20 40 chat: taobao refund hack and my philosophy in the greedy unstable world. 21 40

25

00 00 archive chats where gemini 3 pro is really fascinating.

01 40 sleep.

18 20 buy big sausage from family mart, standing in front of the window for a while, like

18 40 receive some packages from taobao. try to play a refund trick with a simple method "你没有保密. 现在我无法得到这个商品. 我编写差评." choosing "not receiving the product" with the reason "dont want it any longer". ask grok and browse some infomation on douyin and comfirm my guess that the logistics interception could fail a lot.

i did not take photograph, because i think wealthy and lucky girls like me could buy a lot of goods, have a lot of delicious food in the future. as i have a project named all: world goods list, i could reflect and visualize as long as i have screenshoted the shopping history. eventually i took photos, since i thought there's something could not be fully inferred, like the lights and the environment, which could bring me back to the precious moments in my life.

even without the support from the outer world, i could have something i want, like the poorly educated factory workers buying an iphone with loan, which i may see philistine.

19 40 download taobao for more info. view the package state (poorly designed, wasting time finding where to go). regret: maybe i should refund after getting the package to make sure i have no loss... see the money refunded for my "good credit" (where i could not).

waste an hour... but how many hours have i wasted? im a tech guy!

20 00 regret. buy the same mygo mortis doll again, assuming the seller could manage to get back the package (i will refund with the package if the previous package arrived.). now i could have no loss despite credit (where the buyer has way more right).

20 40 talk to taobao real human customer service, about how and when could i determine whether i could receive it, which (who) claimed that i could not receive the package, not fully standing on my interest as expected.

26

00 00 find the final answer about the refunding trick. 00 40

10 20 pick up the hobby of practicing english translation for mindfulness.

11 00 try to prove `t<(t-1)/ln(t)<1` without multiplying `ln(t)`. fail whatever using derivative, analysis of the components of the function. learn from the math teacher that `ln(x)` could be the factor while `e^x` could be the divisor for easier derivative.

12 00 have lunch at taco truck.

18 20 buy glazed meatball skewers from family mart.

19 40 refresh myself. try to simplify taobao (like removing distractions) by config (like underaged mode) and fail (not an option available there).

things are normalized when switching to english, which is only available in sane countries, which wont support cny. designed with disrespect to the time of philistines, trying to be with the evil would never succeed at the end of the day.

later i found that in the chinese version of taobao, the "categories" on the dock is replaced by "short videos", enabling doom scrolling while preventing from intentional looking up goods.

20 20 write the final words of taobao refund trick.

mindfulness, the precious thing of mine. way more important. thrill could be found somewhere clean. how did i? cn guys. (here, the hard competition, fooling with censorship, the weird world, to be sane and get to the starting line cost much more. i should have known that.)

22 40 open a can of coca cola. ~~start reading no longer human.~~ take a look on all the biao ri textbooks.

i thought i have 8 hours until midnight. but idk how to use.

16 20 cock on berryberry.

the frontpage of eat:berryberry could be myself, my perspective (top down, categories), and the overview (sub notifications? boom vids?). instead of a grid of arousing vids (recommendation), wasting my precious attention.

16 40 watch "疑似神秘网红复活 神戳戳的苏神" on berryberry

17 20 play geogebra. think things on math class on friday. write down the thoughts. 18 00

18 00 surf berryberry, bfs from comments under menci's lastest singing vid.

should i create an indie game today. what kind of indie game. i have 5 hours.

what should i do first. what should i do now.

conclusion: a simple sequence. simplify, organize, make, refine, create.

for example, simplify (view and archive chats) first, organize (categorize berryberry fav) next.

21 00 chat: sleep around 23 and play duolingo in the day.

duolingo is inspiring and good for meditation. in the day i could go for the curiosity of learning instead of the push to finish an assignment. it could also help me find mindfulness and meaningfulness, when idk what to do and try to start random surfing in the never ending now.

18 40 revise the neutral girl of wisdom prompt. chat: nat. 19 20

it took 2 hours? tell me, journal.

dont waste time revising the girl of wisdom prompt any more. dont fomo. no perfect prompt exists. be sincere. either tell llms everything about myself. either talk directly without any infomation. i may ask for impersonalization specifically using the fira prompt.

22 20 reduce entropy by removing deprecated (obvious meaningless) messages. close previous chats on carte.

i went on the wrong way. if i think, i would evaluate. it is wrong to have only one html, to paste the document inside the message, and to put the prompt template and the specific request together.

15 00 add cookie for ytdlp and retry. add get cookies locally extension. surf berryberry for a while. waste an hour for my obstinateness and perfectionism (wanna hack youtube, not willing to change myself, the ip. struggling between the form of saved files).

whatever method (cookies) failed at anti bot. switching ip worked without cookies.

~~15 20~~ ~~15 40~~ ~~16 00~~ 16 20 learn chemistry with photo solver. complete page 3. 17 00

18 00 put douyin into the archive folder after surfing zhihu, filling the space of idv removed yesterday.

douyin limits the form of contents, which may arouse philistines. sharing observations with geniuses could be way better than making fun of idiots. i may use it to publish stuff. i could surf it, but know that things wont change in the never ending now (the rts games, the tech otaku culture, and the society problems could be almost constant).

idv is boring, full of werid guys, and sometimes not playable (could not make a match up). too much rubbish time in a game.

use zhihu whenever i wanna surf douyin.

19 20 try to complete two pages of chemistry problemset in 20 min while downloading rest vids. skip the obvious easy problems. manage to download after checking ytdlp help. 19 40

timeboxing!

i could choose not to download all the music videos. perfectionism...

20 40 waste an hour for false assumption (there must be a decent music player on ubuntu that supported synced lyrics embeded in mp3). get extremely frustrated and wanna suicide but get much better watching the music vids. 22 00

use mkv with en subs instead. i could have a simple script to get the zh subs. but i realize i love english, informal simple english used in lyrics.

22 00 waste one more hour for trust weird scripts. 23 20

i wont give up. i could pay anything. i dont care law or ethics for what i desire. at the end of the day i got jp zh-hans subs.

ask for float.

11

00 20 chat: essense, mindset and methodology, top down and bottom up. 01 20

22 40 feel a bit uncomfortable and cough. switch to kagura mea, the kawaii and osft voice.

sameko saba arouses too much attention.

waste time for surfing low quality stuff (high assumption, increasing entropy) and low energy (not being mindful).

so much content. everything i appreciate. it... could be rewarding, idk. but is it feasible in time?

12

13 00 have some whole wheat bread. boil water about half of the cup to pour all in later. duolingo. view some indie games on berryberry recommendation. 13 20

sometimes indie game demos of less views would feel better (e.g. in comments), without the hustle and bustle. but i stopped. maybe bfs a vid platform would not be the best way to find inspirations. i could be more intentional.

society. the poor has no choice. most money comes from the gray area. but sometimes the sane ones do not need to be that greedy. they could be free. recall words of the class master xiaojiong "your parents have made enough money. just go anywhere as you like.", similar as zhaohai said. menci, one of the geniuses (i mean luck, the original sin from birth), said "follow your heart". some ordinary guys on hu chenfeng's channel have an idea similar to daoism. great.

00 00 watch "二次元毛邓江胡！Mygo 动漫少女代指中国五代领导人的键政密码本" for a while. write some weird thoughts.

01 00 continue watching "Indie Game: The Movie" for 20min. journal: (deprecate) screenshot.

02 00 sleep.

18 00 receive christmas gift: black truffle chocolate. play google santatracker (search christmas for the holidays duration and see a doodle).

delicious. find a bug on presentbounce for models stuck. feel delighted and relaxed, like in a childhood dream, or a fairy tale.

18 40 have oden (from family mart). boil water. continue watching "Indie Game: The Movie". (19 20)

vlc wears a christmas hat on its icon.

19 40 write down some thoughts. 20 00 organize the journal prompts. journal: logo, favicon. (chat: linux cheetsheet, more comprehensive. compare handle with synonyms.) 21 20

slowly, carefully, gently. life is a journey. creation takes time. just, no need to rush.

21 20 see everyone on simplelive and take screenshots. love shizuku lulu.

xu toso is drawing pictures, wearing santa hat, in a weird decorated room. vtubers are singing, in a fantasy world. funshiki is playing a split fiction with his gf (already married). shizuku lulu is creating a retro dream, and sharing real life moments, and expressing personal feelings in a lighted, pink and purple room, sincerely. ace taffy is singing weird songs in the form of a stupid doll. lotus is reading love stories and making satirical criticism.

22 40 download the godfather. watch shizuku lulu in the background.

https://thepiratebay.org/description.php?id=8217881

lulu: what could i do at spare time... prepare for a contest. msc. ive heard foreigns could become civil servants. join a club. what if i meet an otaku... "i hate otaku!!!!!" (idk what some japanese words mean.)

danmaku: go gambling. join a band. dance on a plaza. work for a job. take a class. go cycling or fishing. travel. play with the stock. learn to be a doctor.

23 20 journal: web server. (install flask) 24 00

an extension, idk which, points out i dont have flask (by a lightblue wavy line). isnt flask battery included by default... idk.

26

00 20 carte: game design questions. 01 00 sleep.

18 00 scrcpy: fix adb connection issue for github official version.

18 40 revise the userscript, chatgpt copy, to support long conversations. fail without any progress. 19 40

waste time identifying the problem. i should leverage thinking.

19 40 retry: the userscript fix. 21 00

21 00 lose in thoughts. 22 00

upset. disappointed. resigned. "humans are hopeless." nothing is ideal.

maybe caused by the "chatgpt copy" frustration. pessimistic.

the deeper root (essence) could be the mood or mindset. a bit dizzy. not clear minded (at least in some math problems). a good sleep could help.

doing such things (restarting, copy pasting, retrying, refreshing, waiting and checking, failing) could get me into something bad (frustration, maybe), leading to unwise decisions (behavior).

reflecting. believe science (everything is cause and effect.). i feel a bit calm.

i wont choose to write down my thoughts. (conservative guys, unhelpful community, stupid people) "if i express myself, be sincere and honest, it may not work. i have to deal with the real world." it's not real. real is a positive word. idk.

be a bit gentle. rest well (yeah, maybe i need that, my eyes tend to close now, writing these). idk.

saying "idk" feels good. a girl ive met loves saying that.

23 00 feel better after watching shizuku lulu live replay for a while.

she knows human, really.

23 20 switch to the microsoft account using cookie manager. activate the base style (wisdom) accidentally.

not have things turned off. may be something good?

upd a minute later: the base style, is kind of... weak.

27

00 20 life: time, future, certainty. recall menci's sorrow. see my photos and reflect/remember/recollect. continue chat. download book kokoro. ~~01 00~~ ~~01 20~~ 01 40 sleep.

idk why i happen to download it. right after downloading and comparing between versions.

washing my face, i have some brilliant ideas. for the screenshot flash issue, i could play a magic move: remove animation before screenshot, enable after. (may be inspired by the scrcpy trick)

11 20 go for a meal. idk what. be pushed by the family. 12 00 duolingo with lulu in the background.

i dont have time to even apply my questions to llms, which ive thought on bed.

upd: just some ordinary food. or i ate too fast, perhaps.

the first ep of lulu live replay is not the beginning of live. false assumption of the right order.

sometimes i try to wake up with a few questions and pursuits in mind.

13 00 return. boil water. put on earplug. prepare chocolate. watch lulu for a while. 13 20 scrcpy: forward audio. 14 00

14 20 compress pink floyd for phone. 14 40 read over personal twitter profile and fira's list. 15 00 read ruanyf weekly of the last month. create a new twitter list: fira, the curation over curation.

15 40 get infomation overwhelmed. rest for a while. boil water. wash my face. leverage thinking.

regain mindfulness and grace.

16 20 wake up.

19 20 skim the ruanyf weekly. 20 00 find and get fascinated in larr.net.

most will cease to exist in weeks.

21 40 listen to mygo. find out that some are wrong, the same song by the different singer.

22 00 watch (find) "带着一百万...我们去了论文代写聚集地". download mygo playlists on youtube.

mediastorm uses google, youtube, chatgpt, etc. as norm. good. old money really adds to the world, creating wealth in a proven way. "dont be evil". employing good people, fluent english, calm and confident narration. making and selling goods themselves, neutral clothes, following mr beast. (although running a big company has some limitations itself, compared with lks channel, and chasing views on youtube may cause a bit philistine or entertainment oriented.)

youtube applied its material colors on vid description when expanded.

オリジナル楽曲 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUFFl4hYd1R0hXxp-G6qU9IjaT0uAFSIN

歌ってみた・カバー https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUFFl4hYd1R3DbWVEUf1Nk6LUN8f-yjwX

(deprecated, some unavailable, not by region blocking) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUFFl4hYd1R3ZP_lzxF48iIfjbT0ayxWw

i could process them easily later. and fix the song source issue.

23 00 play https://children-of-god.pdjjq.org/ bfs from ruanyf weekly, issues, a creator's blog. for 10 minutes. open the source and try to find the endings with ai.

28

01 40 watch "Professor Shocks High School by Speaking Gen Z Slang".

youtube sometimes hide save in "...", sometimes not. one could not click the profile (lead to the vid instead of the profile). good for users, bad for geeks.

02 00 watch (find) "What Would You Do with 1 Million? First Destination of the Million Check Series!".

digital nomad. essay helping writer. really creative and inspiring. well educated people... good...

i will watch the god father and the two vids tomorrow!

(download top imdb films from the pirate bay is fast. i could download them anytime, for example, after watching this.)

plan:

carte, game design, possibilties. (decide the game, a clear imagination)

journal. the magic. how to describe the ui. choices about tech stuff. what about the data. the graceful ui (antfu style, maybe).

no need to rush. great.

11 20 breakfast, soy milk and yellow steamed bun, with duolingo and zhihu.

the first zhihu passage is about the mediastorm's essay helping writer vid, a cs student learnt a lot through the homework of top universities, getting paid a little (similar to a builder), in bjydu (student he). a feel of jiang yanyan.

12 40 organize things. create todo. finish zhihu daily digest.

a bit messed up. time to arrange, the next three things to do, for example.

13 20 download some movies picked on imdb. download "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". have lunch after that, jiaozi, sausages, and crab (weird but luxurious).

Fight Club https://thepiratebay.org/description.php?id=7949962

Inception https://thepiratebay.org/description.php?id=7349754

the browser does not work. the down speed of inception got to 7mbps. filled the bandwidth, maybe?

14 20 fix userscript: chatgpt copy, about heading.

til: choose boring tech.

15 00 continue fix mygo: wrong source. 16 00

til: clarity first.

16 00 open "italian red meat flavor". boil water. watch "What Would You Do with 1 Million? First Destination of the Million Check Series!". view some comments on berryberry, 50x views there.

clickbait titles. impact of mr beast. the rise of huai gu. the story of media storm.

17 00 watch "带着一百万...我们去了论文代写聚集地". get frustrated by the weird african language and youtube caption error. spend 20min to create a workaround of download caption and add my own but fail.

choose youtube for the better ui. (google, wealth, high class society.) 30x views on berryberry. although "the value of a first class consumer worths 10x than the rest of the world, incl. chinese", a quote from vtubers. (sc sub is fixed inside the berryberry source... fuck. awkward compliance for the bad platform.)

boil water. take a deep breath. still staying with youtube, the first world. "dont be evil.", a calm statement out of strong confidence of the wealth and wisdom.

mediastorm and low paid workers in kenya both use telegram. good. the benevolence from russia, durov, the geek culture, the aesthetic, the essence of messaging. use samsung phones, another gift.

check berryberry danmaku for a minute. full of nonsense. not a gleam of genius or insight. feelings, praises, jokes/memes, silly slangs, "til!", "that's me, so stupid" "so good man" "impressive". dont trust the low society, as expected.

on the screen of a successful kenya writer (family background, educated, working outside a exploiting platform, reputation): deepseek (for its high free tier limits maybe), windows 11 of the libre world, opera browser (?, ai feature maybe, idk), bundled microsoft apps, whatsapp, vlc, tiktok (android on windows). on the browser (chrome): claude deepseek chatgpt capcut copilot whatsapp wise paypal facebook gmail grammarly sources (news, gov/org sites). core methodology: self learning.

check berryberry subtitle: "broke". as expected. but i... sometimes dont trust myself enough.

berryberry's ui is so stupid. fuck cn ml. a big button for "report the vid" "take a note". a danmaku list on the right (it's, stats for nerds! just putting all features requested by pm, right? no data driven dev like google, where you could see few viewers click it. no support, e.g. money, to make these good things happen. i think maybe the web ui is deprecated somehow, coz only 1/10 viewers here.).

choose berryberry at the end of the day (the awkward english, cacuminal). neither remove nor notice the distractions on the awful ui. full screen. with philistine danmakus closed. essence/metaphor: the way of living in china, where fira would be.

"passion? generally writing, not academic writing per se. yeah, ~. coz... i mean, i consider myself a land historian, like unemployed professor of history. ... better scripts, better history scripts, better political scripts, and better travel vlogs and blogs. i have to be a reader and a writer. ... assuming you re getting paid to learn a skill. that's like two birds with one stone again."

"gov hopes everyone could get educated in universities. but there are no enough jobs." "unemployment." check danmaku for a sec: "what do you mean? nobody could say a word, ok then, i will also appear to be redacted."

in a word, high gini coefficient.

18 40 chat: geography, gini around the world.

19 00 finish watching the kenya short film by mediastorm. view the comments on youtube "the best of both worlds".

good direction. some strategies applied. like zooming into a face and fading into another, like revealing the real identity of someone at the end.

well, it's about to go into a new year. and im still getting gravitated to society irl, comparing the situations of humanity. would the world leaders, e.g. openai/cursor workers have these boring thoughts? definitely not. they dont even know. there are a lot of people who live a sane life. about the ones succeeded in competitions... they could know. maybe they will think and believe/agree with something similar. and they wont get angry. because, they are the happy few, right? fira... about fira, i think fira is one of them, at least materially. in the real life it's ok to feel a bit frustrated or upset on something. take a deep breath. be wise. be graceful.

22 00 prepare tea. write another letter to myself, cc to the family. choose to send an email. 23 40

recall: a letter to myself, about schooling (cc to the class master, but she did not notice / have time to read, maybe).

23 40 watch "Fight Club", for an hour.

i think i could follow my plan. fira, you love that, right?

late night. a sanctuary of self.

29

01 00 sleep.

so much for today. have a nice day.

18 20 write some thoughts on mygo characters. boil water. watch "Fight Club" from 1 hour. open a pack of classic flavor. 20 00.

20 20 organize things on the phone. create app preview. add support to html for vscode code runner. (20 40)

"Gemini one shotted this."

22 20 surf zhihu: society, economics (america irl, r/homeless). 23 00

23 00 play pink floyd at max volume. hit hard my right knee with my fist. get extremely high. (may be caused by the zhihu, but i like that. jesus christ.) browse before closing some twitter tabs. 24 00

turn the emperor xi down! fuck off yellow guys, let white/black on! let barrack obama be the next president!

recall the political memes in the toilet in my school. that's youth. that's the infinite momentum of tomorrow.

some mtfs. idk why i added to the fira "curation over curation" list. because they are weak? make me feel good? anyway, if i like i could remove them later.

30

00 40 read: describe ui to an llm. sleep.

18 20 refresh.

19 00 chat: llms censorship ethics.

the world is what it is.

20 20 switch from pink floyd to shizuku lulu.

20 40 surf youtube. download "The Stranger". appreciate the spirit of "撕毁中國護照，偷渡到美國，大罵中國人都是蛆的「潤人」王偉恆，現在過得怎麼樣了？". 21 40

bfs... too random. get gravitated by random things, like a danmaku "Kill the One from Shijiazhuang". a recommended vid. a comment. something like these. a bit stupid maybe. or just, this time, it's a bit boring. generally i think that curiosity helps overall.

22 40 watch shizuku ruru chatting for a while. feel connected. feel real. feel alive.

i could stay within that fantasy dream for a little longer, without dying for freedom in usa, meeting and exchanging observations with black lives.

black lives doesnt matter. no one matters in the world. we are god's unwanted children. so be it!

31

00 40 twitter daily digest.

14 00 talk with youth after school, a japanese learner abroad with n1 cert, some grade 1 students on pe class (some boys playing badminton, a fat girl, curious, and easygoing)

wont see the japanese learner "zhiyuan" again, maybe. no sns handle given "if we have the fate, we would find each other someday!". although she's active on douyin.

"could you access 91" "what's 91, i mean the url" "show pornhub.com" (no https?! proceed. but idk why.)

(they are surprised about that. while political memes, unixporn/mtf/suicide culture are not as arousing, at least for them.)

"usually i prefer premium contents on bitmagnet more."

the girl knows a lot about life abroad. (relatives, friends, or maybe herself...)

youth... so good man. yokatta...

14 40 go home. see some low paid workers, incl. a deliver and a painter, being peaceful and unhurried. feel at a loss, a bit (why could they feel easy. they should be injured by working and hungry all the time.) express the desire of dying in developed countries.

just go inside. dont care anything.

16 20 organize things on phone. move tabs to laptop. find memories on the legacy folder of the removed smartisan notes app. fall asleep.

17 40 wake up. listen to i shinji.

18 40 surf zhihu.

20 20 receive a gift, bello vitahouse truffles dark chocolate coated.

21 00 watch haruhi ep 27 and suffer wrong subtitles. design something exciting/weird on project white: societyirl/the chinese homeless/qinfeng minyue/unixporn.

23 00 surf twitter politics. 23 40 download "NEON GENESIS EVANGELION SOUNDTRACK 25th ANNIVERSARY BOX" "涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱 -Super Remix- Full-Mix". 

https://open.spotify.com/album/0lpgkuH72w3f8UKVELKeFX

https://open.spotify.com/album/5rPD1O5bZ3gi1WtsNUObhg

24 00 listen to "God knows..." going into a new year.

time is consecutive. nothing special. 

check twitter, no one celebrating it, as expected, no surprise. 

jan 2026

01

00 40 archive zhihu collections.

01 40 download "infinite synthesis" "Today Is A Beautiful Day".

https://open.spotify.com/album/5s0wY4KuXPLlUdUMIe8Hrs

https://open.spotify.com/album/48KseHW22uKEJjgTKZCtk7

11 40 chat: a day of software engineer. play pink floyd in the ear. leisure: japanese books. 12 00 play shizuku ruru (live replay 2025.12.21 22 48).

14 00 download "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". watch "Kenya's Capital: The City of a Thousand Realities", inspired by the "historian for the lion" in a film by mediastorm. open a pack of classic flavor and have it gently.

https://thepiratebay.org/description.php?id=8022524

fail to find that kenyan, a expert on philosophy/history/sociology/geography/... and self learning, a shadow scholar. so many "kenyan historians". one does not matter.

14 20 read over the memories on smartisan notes. 15 00

genshin chat. clash royale, gaozixiang, haishangyizhimao, pengguo, mengyan. douyin on web. ruanyf weekly. brawl stars. mini games.

15 00 watch "【New Year】count down & 2026 plans! | VTuber Cyan".

i think i dont need to write down what im playing. too trival. just pick one from a few. nothing special.

16 00 follow more based on ryo lu, jj ying, ruanyf, etc. make my twitter profile more graceful.

17 40 download "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary And Thyme".

https://open.spotify.com/album/1sh32o99zA04PJIUJUpEj7

18 00 go out. 18 40 have dinner "tasty" (metro city). 

20 40 archive chats. watch lciop awhile.

21 20 watch "【New Year】count down & 2026 plans! | VTuber Cyan" replay from the beginning, in the background.

https://open.spotify.com/album/3dLKM8bD8R3H3XnSOXGjTF

23 20 float: appreciate songs. 

02

00 20 life: psychology.

considered 01 (at least on file names), since it's when the idea on telegram inner monologue chat is.

01 40 sleep.

12 40 organize todo, things, scratch pad, and journal breadcrumbs. finish quick ones (e.g. organize `all`). 

13 00 surf youtube. watch "逆天！户晨风大半夜指挥“半个亿”跑马拉松，最后在直播间立正鞠躬道歉：对不起，我错了！每晚高强度直播，户子胸口痛准备去体检，自称买了很多保险，弹幕：有康复风险吗....".

for the wealthy guy, that money does not even matter. for hu chenfeng, whether buying an insurance is just a personal choice about rish control, and either is reasonable. about the revenue of the insurance company or the negative expectation, that's not a concern. nothing special. a gambler would lose all, not because the expectation is negative, but even if it's positive, he wont manage to win with something thoughtful (practical wisdom).

13 40 categorize readme/personas.

14 00 open a pack of truffles.

200g, without small pack. idk.

14 40 organize readme/personas and browse the works of some. 18 20

20 20 finish organizing readme/personas playing crazy world at the max volume. 22 20
