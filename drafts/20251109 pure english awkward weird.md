### The Gray Area: Where They Overlap

The line can blur, especially when describing a person or a situation that is _both_ strange and socially uncomfortable.

- **"That was a weird conversation."** (It was strange and probably had odd topics.)
- **"That was an awkward conversation."** (It was socially uncomfortable, with pauses or taboo subjects.)

Often, a situation can start as **weird** and become **awkward**.

> _Example:_ Your colleague tells a **weird** story about his pet iguana (**strange**). Everyone falls silent because they don't know how to respond (**awkward**).

### Summary

Choose **awkward** when you mean **uncomfortable, clumsy, or embarrassing.**
Choose **weird** when you mean **strange, odd, or unconventional.**

Think of it this way: A silent elevator ride with a stranger is **awkward**. A silent elevator ride with a stranger dressed as a clown is **weird**.
