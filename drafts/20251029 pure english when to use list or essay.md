"when to use list or essay in the main text" is it grammatically correct

---

Excellent question. Let's break it down.

### The Short Answer

No, the phrase **"when to use list or essay in the main text" is not grammatically correct.**

It's a sentence fragment, not a complete sentence.

---

### The Grammatical Problem

The phrase is missing a subject and a main verb. It's a noun phrase posing as a question.

- **"when to use list or essay in the main text"** functions as a single, complex noun. It's the _topic_, but it's not doing any action.

To make it a proper sentence, you need to add a verb. For example:

- **"When should you use a list or an essay in the main text?"** (This is a direct question.)
- **"I am unsure when to use a list or an essay in the main text."** (This is a statement where the phrase is the object.)
- **"This guide explains when to use a list or an essay in the main text."** (This is a statement where the phrase is the object.)

---

### The Underlying Confusion (and the Correct Words to Use)

Your question hints at a common confusion between the verb and the noun forms of these words.

- **List:** As a **verb**, it means "to itemize." As a **noun**, it refers to the itemized series itself (e.g., a bulleted list).
- **Essay:** As a **verb** (less common), it means "to attempt or try." As a **noun**, it refers to a short piece of writing on a particular subject.

In your context, you are clearly using them as **nouns**. Therefore, the correct phrasing needs the articles **"a"** or **"an"**.

**Corrected Phrases:**

- "...use **a** list or **an** essay..."
- "...use **a** list versus **an** essay..."

# 2

just consider it a sentence fragment

---

Of course. As a sentence fragment, **"when to use list or essay in the main text"** is perfectly acceptable and understandable.

Fragments are incomplete sentences, but they are widely used and considered correct in many contexts, such as:

- **Titles and Headings:** This phrase would work well as the title of a blog post or a section in a style guide.
- **Notes and Lists:** It's a concise way to state a topic in your notes or on a to-do list.
- **Questions (in informal settings):** In a quick chat or email to a colleague, this fragment clearly communicates what you want to know.

The only minor improvement, even as a fragment, would be to include the articles for maximum clarity:

- **"When to use a list or an essay in the main text."**

This makes it a perfectly standard and functional noun phrase that effectively introduces the topic.

omitting articles is wrong. but i often see it

---

You are absolutely right. This is an excellent observation that touches on a key difference between formal grammar and real-world usage.

While omitting articles (a, an, the) is technically grammatically "wrong" in a full sentence, it is **extremely common and often correct in specific contexts.** This is a style of language known as **"headlinese"** or **telegraphic style**.

The rule is: In formal, prose writing (like an essay or a report), you should use articles. However, in many other common situations, they are intentionally omitted for brevity and impact.

Here are the most common places you see articles correctly omitted:

### 1. Titles and Headlines

The goal is to be short and grab attention.

- **Formal Sentence:** "The Company Announces a New Product"
- **Common Headline:** **"Company Announces New Product"**

### 2. Lists and Bullet Points

The structure makes the meaning clear without the need for full sentences.

- **Formal Sentence:** "Please remember to bring a jacket, a water bottle, and your passport."
- **Common in a List:**
  - **Bring:**
    - Jacket
    - Water bottle
    - Passport

### 3. Notes & Instructions (especially in recipes)

Speed and clarity are the priority.

- **Formal Sentence:** "Add two cups of flour to the mixture."
- **Recipe Instruction:** **"Add two cups flour."**

### 4. Labels and Signs

Space is limited, and the context is obvious.

- **Formal Sentence:** "The exit is to the rear of the building."
- **Sign on a door:** **"Exit"** or **"Fire Exit"**

### 5. Certain Grammatical Structures after 'to'

Your original fragment, "when to use...," falls into this category. When a noun follows "how to," "when to," "what to," etc., the article can often be dropped, especially in titles or informal notes.

- **Formal:** "This is a guide on how to build **a** table."
- **Informal/Title:** "How to Build Table"

### Conclusion

So, you are correct to notice this! Your instinct that "omitting articles is wrong" is the safe rule for formal writing. But your observation that you "often see it" is also correct because it's a standard feature of many efficient, non-formal communication styles.

**To summarize:**

- **In your main essay text?** Use articles. (Formal prose)
- **In the title of your essay, your bullet points, or your notes?** Omitting articles is not only acceptable but often preferred. (Telegraphic style)
