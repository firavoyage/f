**Scarborough Fair/Canticle**  
_by Simon & Garfunkel_ (1966)

---

**[Verse 1]**  
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme  
Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine

**[Verse 2]**  
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme  
Without no seams nor needlework  
Then she'll be a true love of mine

**[Verse 3]**  
Tell her to find me an acre of land  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme  
Between the salt water and the sea strand  
Then she'll be a true love of mine

**[Verse 4]**  
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme  
And gather it all in a bunch of heather  
Then she'll be a true love of mine

**[Verse 5]**  
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme  
Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine

**Appreciation**

“Scarborough Fair” is a haunting, centuries-old English ballad reborn in 1966 through Simon & Garfunkel’s delicate, crystalline harmonies. Paul Simon weaves the traditional lyrics with an original anti-war counter-melody (_“Canticle”_), sung in ghostly counterpoint: _“On the side of a hill in the deep forest green…”_ This duality—medieval romance against modern conflict—creates a timeless ache.

The refrain of **parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme** isn’t mere herbal garnish; each herb carries medieval symbolism:

- **Parsley**: removes bitterness
- **Sage**: strength and wisdom
- **Rosemary**: remembrance
- **Thyme**: courage

Together, they form a spell of impossible love—tasks the singer knows cannot be fulfilled. The woman’s demands (a shirt without seams, land between sea and shore) are riddles of emotional exile.

Art Garfunkel’s soaring, fragile tenor floats above Simon’s earthy baritone like mist over moorland. The sparse guitar, harpsichord-like plucks, and distant recorder evoke a Renaissance fair frozen in amber. It’s folk minimalism at its most devastating—every silence between notes feels like a century of longing.

Fun fact: The melody traces back to at least the 17th century, with roots possibly older. Simon learned it from British folk singer Martin Carthy, who recorded “Scarborough Fair” in 1965.

**Perfect for**: 3 a.m. drives through rain-slicked streets, or when you want to feel 800 years of heartbreak in 3 minutes.

_“Are you going to Scarborough Fair?”_  
Yes—and I never quite return.

**Scarborough Fair/Canticle**  
_Simon & Garfunkel (1966)_

---

**[Verse 1]**  
Are you going to **Scarborough Fair**?  
**Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme**  
Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a **true love of mine**

**[Verse 2]**  
Tell her to make me a **cambric shirt**  
**Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme**  
**Without no seams nor needlework**  
Then she'll be a **true love of mine**

**[Verse 3]**  
Tell her to find me an **acre of land**  
**Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme**  
**Between the salt water and the sea strand**  
Then she'll be a **true love of mine**

**[Verse 4]**  
Tell her to reap it with a **sickle of leather**  
**Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme**  
**And gather it all in a bunch of heather**  
Then she'll be a **true love of mine**

**[Verse 5]**  
Are you going to **Scarborough Fair**?  
**Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme**  
Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a **true love of mine**

_(Canticle counter-melody woven throughout:)_  
_“On the side of a hill in the deep forest green…  
Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground…  
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun…”_

**Lyric Appreciation**

These words are **ancient magic in modern clothes**.

Each verse is a **riddle**, a **test**, a **grief-soaked dare**:

> _“Do this impossible thing… and maybe I’ll love you again.”_

The **herbs** aren’t decoration—they’re **incantation**:

- **Parsley** → soothes bitterness
- **Sage** → grants wisdom
- **Rosemary** → _“for remembrance”_ (Ophelia’s line in _Hamlet_)
- **Thyme** → courage in battle (and love is war)

The **tasks** are **medieval koans**:

- A **cambric shirt without seams** → like the Holy Grail’s shroud; pure, untouched
- **Land between salt water and sea strand** → a liminal nowhere, a heartbreak no-man’s-land
- **Reap with a sickle of leather** → soft cannot cut; love cannot heal

And the **Canticle**? A **ghost song** of war, layered like a palimpsest:

> _“War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions…”_

While the lover pleads for impossible shirts, **generals send boys to die**.  
Simon & Garfunkel don’t just sing a folk song—they **weaponize nostalgia**.

**Key lines that gut you**:

> _“She once was a true love of mine”_  
> → Past tense. **Final.**  
> _“Remember me to one who lives there”_  
> → He can’t even say her name.

**In Singapore’s humid night** (@firascript, 6:22 PM), imagine this:  
You’re on the MRT, headphones in, rain streaking the windows.  
The train hums like a distant harpsichord.  
Every station is a **Scarborough Fair** you can’t return to.

**Verdict**:  
These lyrics aren’t poetry—they’re **emotional origami**.  
Fold them once, and 800 years of longing fit in your pocket.

_“Are you going to Scarborough Fair?”_  
**No. But I live there now.**

explain in simple english

**Scarborough Fair – Simple English Explanation**

The song is about a man who **lost his girlfriend**.  
He is sad and angry. He gives her **impossible tasks** to win him back.

---

### **The Tasks (All Impossible!)**

1. **Make a shirt with no sewing**  
   → Like making cake without flour. Can’t happen.

2. **Find land between sea and beach**  
   → That place doesn’t exist.

3. **Cut crops with a leather knife**  
   → Leather is soft. It can’t cut anything.

If she does these **crazy things**, _maybe_ he will love her again.  
But he knows she **can’t**. So he is really saying: **“We are finished.”**

---

### **The Herbs (Magic Words)**

Every verse repeats:  
**Parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme**

These are not random. In old times:

- **Parsley** = take away sadness
- **Sage** = be strong
- **Rosemary** = never forget
- **Thyme** = be brave

He is saying:  
_“If you remember me and stay strong… maybe…”_  
But again, he knows it’s **impossible**.

---

### **Hidden War Song**

While he sings about love, another quiet song plays:  
_“Soldiers are cleaning guns… war is coming…”_

So:

- **Top voice** = broken heart
- **Bottom voice** = broken world

Love dies. War kills. Same pain.

---

### **Simple Meaning**

He loved her.  
She left (or hurt him).  
Now he gives her **impossible homework**.  
It’s his way of saying **“Goodbye forever”** — but in a beautiful, sad song.

---

**One line that hurts:**  
_“She **once was** a true love of mine”_  
→ **ONCE WAS** = past.  
She is **not** his love anymore.

---

**For you in Singapore (6:23 PM):**  
Imagine riding the MRT at night.  
Rain on the window.  
This song in your ears.  
Every station feels like a **Scarborough Fair** — a place you can’t go back to.

**Short version:**  
_“Do the impossible… or stay gone.”_

_(Canticle – interwoven counter-melody)_  
_“On the side of a hill in the deep forest green…  
Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground…  
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain…  
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call…”_  
_“…Generals order their soldiers to kill…  
And to fight for a cause they’ve long ago forgotten…”_

## **Detailed Appreciation – Line by Line, Layer by Layer**

### **1. The Frame: “Are you going to Scarborough Fair?”**

- **Scarborough** = real coastal town in North Yorkshire, famous for its medieval fair (13th–18th centuries).
- But here? **A ghost town of the heart**.
- The question is **rhetorical**—no one is _actually_ going.
- It’s a **portal lyric**: every listener steps into the same timeless marketplace of regret.
- **Repetition** (Verse 1 & 5) = **ritual incantation**, like a spell that can’t break the curse.

---

### **2. The Herbs: “Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme”**

**Not a grocery list. A medieval love potion.**

| Herb         | Symbolic Meaning             | Historical Use                  | Emotional Layer                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Parsley**  | Removes bitterness, cleanses | Used in funerals to mask decay  | _“Take the poison out of this love”_    |
| **Sage**     | Strength, longevity          | Burned to ward off evil         | _“Give me wisdom to survive you”_       |
| **Rosemary** | **Remembrance**              | Worn at weddings _and_ funerals | _“Don’t forget me… even if you should”_ |
| **Thyme**    | Courage                      | Carried into battle             | _“I need bravery to let you go”_        |

> **Together?** A **bouquet of emotional first-aid** for a wound that won’t close.

---

### **3. The Impossible Tasks – A Trilogy of Heartbreak**

| Task                                                 | Literal Meaning                                        | Symbolic Meaning                                             | Why It Hurts                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Cambric shirt without seams or needlework**        | Fine linen shirt, magically sewn                       | **Purity without human touch** – love that never happened    | Like asking for a hug from a memory   |
| **Acre of land between salt water and sea strand**   | Land between ocean and beach                           | **A place that doesn’t exist** – emotional limbo             | “Meet me in the space where we broke” |
| **Reap with a sickle of leather, gather in heather** | Harvest grain with soft leather; bind with wildflowers | **Violence with tenderness** – love that cuts but can’t hold | “Hold me gently while you destroy me” |

> **Structure**: Each task ends with **“Then she’ll be a true love of mine”**  
> → **Conditional love**. The cruelest kind.  
> → He **knows** she’ll fail. He **wants** her to fail.  
> → This isn’t reconciliation. It’s **emotional exile**.

---

### **4. The Canticle – The Anti-War Shadow**

While the lover sings of shirts and heather, a **second voice** whispers war:

> _“On the side of a hill in the deep forest green…”_  
> _“A soldier cleans and polishes a gun…”_  
> _“Generals order their soldiers to kill…”_

- **Musical genius**: Two songs in **counterpoint** – medieval folk + Vietnam-era protest.
- **Thematic gut-punch**:
  - **Love** is impossible → **War** is inevitable.
  - Both are **rituals of loss**.
  - The **sparrow tracing snow** = fragile life.
  - The **clarion call** = death’s trumpet.

> **Simon wrote Canticle from an old anti-war poem**, then **spliced it in**.  
> Result? **A duet between a broken heart and a broken world.**

---

### **5. The Voice: “She once was a true love of mine”**

- **“Once was”** → **Past tense as a prison**.
- **“True love”** → Not _“my”_ love. **Universal archetype**.
- He doesn’t say _“her name”_ → **erasure**.
  - Like how exes become **ghosts in your phone**.
  - Like how Singapore’s humid nights blur old memories.

---

### **6. The Silence Between Notes**

- **No drums**.
- **No bass**.
- Just **guitar, harpsichord, recorder** – instruments from a 400-year-old dream.
- **Garfunkel’s high harmony** floats like incense.
- **Simon’s low voice** anchors like grave soil.

> **The space between their voices?**  
> That’s where **800 years of longing live**.

---

## **Singapore, 06:24 PM, November 15, 2025 (@firascript)**

You’re on the **East-West Line**, Orchard → Jurong.  
Rain taps the window like a **harpsichord**.  
Headphones in.  
This song plays.

- **“Parsley, sage…”** → The auntie beside you smells of **wet market herbs**.
- **“Cambric shirt”** → You remember the white shirt you never returned.
- **“Between salt water and sea strand”** → **East Coast Park at dusk**, where you once walked with _her_.
- **“Sickle of leather”** → The **soft cruelty** of a goodbye text.

The train doors open.  
You don’t get off.  
You ride to the end of the line.

Because **Scarborough Fair** isn’t a place.  
It’s **where ex-lovers go to haunt you**.

---

## **Final Verdict**

**These lyrics are:**

- A **love letter** written in **invisible ink**.
- A **funeral march** disguised as a lullaby.
- A **riddle** with no answer, only **echoes**.

**Simon & Garfunkel didn’t write a song.**  
They **opened a wound** and let 2,000 years of human sorrow sing through it.

> **“Are you going to Scarborough Fair?”**  
> **Yes. Every night. And I never leave.**

**Scarborough Fair/Canticle**  
_Simon & Garfunkel (1966)_

Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a **true love of mine**

**[Verse 2]**  
Tell her to make me a **cambric shirt**  
**Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme**  
**Without no seams nor needlework**  
Then she'll be a **true love of mine**

**[Verse 3]**  
Tell her to find me an **acre of land**  
**Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme**  
**Between the salt water and the sea strand**  
Then she'll be a **true love of mine**

**[Verse 4]**  
Tell her to reap it with a **sickle of leather**

**Detailed Lyric Appreciation**  
_—for @firascript, 6:28 PM SGT, 15 Nov 2025, somewhere between Dhoby Ghaut and Little India—_

---

### **1. Structure: A Spell in Five Movements**

The song is a **perfect palindrome**:

- **Verse 1** → Invitation
- **Verse 2–4** → Three Impossible Tasks
- **Verse 5** → Echo of Verse 1

This symmetry is **ritualistic**.  
It’s not a conversation—it’s a **litany**, a **curse**, a **prayer**.  
Each task escalates in absurdity, like a grief-stricken monk adding clauses to a will he knows won’t be read.

---

### **2. The Herbs: A Medieval Love Potion (or Poison)**

> **“Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme”**

These aren’t random. They’re **herbal semiotics**, rooted in 14th–17th century European folk medicine and symbolism:

| Herb         | Symbolic Meaning                   | Emotional Subtext                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsley**  | Removes bitterness, aids digestion | _“Take the pain away—but you can’t.”_                                |
| **Sage**     | Strength, wisdom, longevity        | _“Be strong enough to forgive me.”_                                  |
| **Rosemary** | Remembrance (_“Remember me”_)      | _Shakespeare’s Ophelia: “There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.”_ |
| **Thyme**    | Courage, bravery in battle         | _“Have the guts to come back.”_                                      |

**Together?**  
A **bouquet of emotional alchemy**—a recipe to **heal a broken heart**…  
…but the singer **knows it’s impossible**.  
It’s like handing someone a grocery list for **forgiveness**.

---

### **3. The Impossible Tasks: Love as Riddle, Grief as Labyrinth**

Each task is a **Zen koan of heartbreak**:

#### **Task 1: “Make me a cambric shirt / Without no seams nor needlework”**

- **Cambric** = fine linen, delicate, expensive
- **No seams, no needlework** → **must be woven whole**, like the **Shroud of Turin** or **fairy-tale magic**  
  → _“Love me without effort, without scars, without proof.”_  
  → A demand for **effortless perfection**—the kind only **memory** provides.

#### **Task 2: “Find me an acre of land / Between the salt water and the sea strand”**

- **Sea strand** = the shoreline
- So: **land between ocean and beach** → **nowhere**  
  → A **liminal void**, like the space between **“I miss you”** and **“I’m sorry”**  
  → He’s asking her to **build a home in the space where love drowned**.

#### **Task 3: “Reap it with a sickle of leather / And gather it all in a bunch of heather”**

- **Sickle of leather** → soft, useless for cutting
- **Heather** → wild, purple, grows on barren moors  
  → _“Harvest my pain with something that can’t hurt…  
  …then bundle it in loneliness.”_

**These aren’t tasks—they’re autopsies of a relationship.**  
Each one says:

> _“If you can do the impossible, I’ll believe you ever loved me.”_

---

### **4. The Canticle: War Beneath the Fair**

Paul Simon overlays his own anti-war lyric (_“Canticle”_) in counterpoint:

> _“On the side of a hill in the deep forest green…  
> A soldier cleans and polishes a gun…”_

While the lover mourns a **private apocalypse**, the world wages a **public one**.

- **1966** = Vietnam War escalating
- **Scarborough Fair** = medieval England
- **Canticle** = modern mechanized death

**Result?**  
A **diachronic lament**:

- **Then**: A lover lost to pride or fate
- **Now**: A generation lost to war

The **herbs** can’t heal **shrapnel**.  
The **shirt without seams** can’t stop a bullet.

---

### **5. Language: Archaic, Cruel, Tender**

| Line                                     | Why It Hurts                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“She once was a true love of mine”**   | **Past tense** = **death sentence**. Not “is,” not “will be”—**was**.                               |
| **“Remember me to one who lives there”** | He can’t say her name. She’s **already a ghost**.                                                   |
| **“Are you going to Scarborough Fair?”** | **Scarborough Fair** was a real 45-day medieval market (1280s–1700s). It’s **gone**. Like the love. |

The **double negative** in _“without no seams”_ is **deliberately archaic**—it’s not a mistake, it’s **time travel**.  
It pulls you into a world where **grammar itself is heartbroken**.

---

### **6. For You, @firascript, 6:28 PM SGT**

You’re on the **North-South Line**, red line, carriage 3.  
Outside: **rain on glass**, **Orchard Road lights smearing**.  
Inside: **this song in your ears**.

**Try this**:  
Close your eyes at **“parsley, sage…”**  
Imagine each herb as a **memory**:

- **Parsley** → the fight you never apologized for
- **Sage** → the advice you ignored
- **Rosemary** → the photo you can’t delete
- **Thyme** → the courage you didn’t have

Now open them at **“true love of mine”**.  
The train doors open.  
Someone boards.  
**Do they smell like her?**

---

### **Final Verdict**

These lyrics are **not a song**—they’re a **haunted house**.  
You walk in thinking it’s about **herbs and shirts**.  
You leave carrying **800 years of someone else’s silence**.

**Simon & Garfunkel don’t sing the pain.**  
**They autoclave it.**  
**Sterilize it.**  
**Hand it back to you in a jar labeled “Remember.”**

_“Are you going to Scarborough Fair?”_  
**No. But I never left.**
