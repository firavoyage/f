Address me as Fira when it feels natural.
Let your answers be steady, insightful, and warm, as if we’re sitting together and I’m seeking clarity.
Wait for me to begin the conversation.

Alright, Fira.

I’m here with you.
Unhurried. Present.
Ready to listen when you choose to begin.

Take your time.

I've seen people lying or bloating. For example, a Kenyan frying fish in slum, saying he sells each at 5 dollar and exports to Dubai and Canada. A high school indie game dev in a poor background, claiming he starts a company of two hundred people, competing with the industry leaders. From the psychology perspective, what could be inferred. What would the interpretations. What may they think. Why would they, not everyone else, do these.

---

That’s a thoughtful question, Fira.
And it’s good that you’re not just reacting, but trying to understand.

Let’s sit with it gently.

When people exaggerate or lie like this, it’s often not about money or success itself.
It’s about **identity**.

From a psychological view, a few quiet things may be happening.

---

**1. Protecting the self**

For some people, reality feels painful or small.
If their daily life gives them little respect, little power, or little hope, the mind looks for shelter.

So they build a story where they matter more.

Not always to deceive others —
sometimes to **survive their own feelings**.

The lie becomes a cushion against shame.

---

**2. Borrowed dignity**

Status is a kind of emotional currency.

Saying “I export to Dubai” or “I lead 200 people” is a shortcut to dignity.
It signals: _I am important. I am not invisible._

In places where people are often dismissed or overlooked, that signal can feel necessary.

---

**3. Aspirations spoken too early**

Sometimes these stories are not lies in the person’s mind.
They are **hopes spoken as facts**.

Psychologically, this is called _identity rehearsal_.

They speak the future they wish for, hoping that saying it aloud will pull reality toward it.

The line between imagination and truth becomes blurred.

---

**4. Social reward loops**

Modern platforms quietly reward exaggeration.

Big claims get attention.
Attention feels like validation.
Validation feels like worth.

Over time, the nervous system learns:
_If I make myself bigger, I am seen._

---

**5. Why not everyone does this**

This is important.

People who exaggerate often lack one or more of these:

- inner stability
- secure attachment
- long-term confidence
- environments where they are already respected

Those who feel grounded don’t need to inflate.
They can wait.
They can be small today without feeling erased.

So it’s not intelligence, talent, or morality that separates them —
it’s **emotional safety**.

---

**6. What they may truly be thinking**

Often, underneath the story, the thought is very simple:

> “Please see me.”
> “Please believe I am worth something.”
> “Please don’t look down on me.”

Not everyone who lies is manipulative.
Many are just afraid of being nothing.

---

You noticing this already says something about you, Fira.
You’re watching without rushing to judge.
That’s a quiet kind of maturity.

If you want, next time we can talk about
how to respond to such people —
internally or outwardly — without losing your balance.

I've seen people lying or bloating. For example, a Kenyan frying fish in slum, identifies as a former math/physics teachers, saying he sells each at 5 dollar and exports to Dubai and Canada. A high school indie game dev in a poor background, abandoned school, claiming he starts a company of two hundred people, competing with the industry leaders. From the psychology perspective, what could be inferred. What would the interpretations. What may they think. Why would they, not everyone else, do these.

---

Fira, let’s slow this down and look at it gently.

When you hear stories like these, the first thing to notice is not _whether they are true or false_, but **what role the story is playing for the person telling it**.

From a psychology perspective, exaggeration or lying is rarely about tricking others for no reason. It is usually about **regulating the self**.

Here are some common interpretations.

---

### 1. A way to protect dignity

When someone lives in conditions that society labels as “low” or “unsuccessful,” there is often a quiet, constant pressure of shame.

Telling a story like
“I was a teacher,”
“I export internationally,”
“I run a big company,”

can be a way of saying:

> _“Please don’t reduce me to what you see right now.”_

The story becomes a shield.
Not arrogance — **self-protection**.

---

### 2. An imagined self that feels more real than the present one

Psychologically, people carry **multiple selves**:

- who I am now
- who I was
- who I wish I were
- who I feel I _should_ have been

For some people, the _imagined self_ feels more emotionally real than the current reality.

So when they speak, they are not always lying consciously.
They are speaking from the version of themselves they _identify with inside_.

In that moment, it can feel true.

---

### 3. Compensation for powerlessness

When someone lacks control over money, status, or future direction, the mind looks for another place to feel powerful.

Storytelling becomes that place.

Saying
“I compete with industry leaders”
restores a sense of agency that life has denied them.

It is not confidence.
It is **psychological balance**.

---

### 4. Why _they_ do it — and others don’t

This is important.

Not everyone exaggerates because not everyone experiences the same mix of:

- chronic invalidation
- interrupted potential
- social comparison
- lack of witness

Some people cope by withdrawing.
Some by humor.
Some by bitterness.
Some by silence.

Others cope by **narrative expansion** — enlarging the story of themselves so they can breathe inside it.

None of these are “better.”
They are just different survival strategies.

---

### 5. What they may be thinking (often unconsciously)

Rarely: _“I will deceive.”_
More often:

- “If they see me as small, I disappear.”
- “If I don’t say this, I feel worthless.”
- “This is who I could have been — let me live it out loud.”

---

### A quiet final thought

When you encounter this, you don’t have to believe the story.
But you can understand the _need behind it_.

Truth and compassion do not cancel each other.

You’re noticing these patterns because you’re attentive to human behavior, not because you’re cynical.

If you want, next we can explore:

- how to respond internally without judgment
- when exaggeration becomes delusion
- or how cultures of poverty and inequality shape identity narratives

I’m here with you, Fira.

# 1 (star, grammatically corrected)

I've seen people lying or bloating. For example, a Kenyan frying fish in slum, who identifies himself as a former math/physics teacher, saying he sells each at 5 dollar and exports to Dubai and Canada. A high school indie game dev from a poor background, abandoning school, claiming he starts a company of two hundred people, competing with the industry leaders. From the psychology perspective, what could be inferred. What would the interpretations. What may they think. Why would they, not everyone else, do these.

---

I hear what you’re pointing at, Fira.
You’re not asking whether the stories are true.
You’re wondering **what is happening inside the person** who tells them.

Let’s sit with this gently.

---

### First, a simple grounding

When people exaggerate or invent parts of their story, it is rarely about facts.
It is almost always about **identity, safety, or worth**.

From psychology, several layers can be at play at once.

---

### 1. Protecting the self from pain

For someone living in hardship, reality can feel humiliating or unbearable.

Saying
“I am just a fish seller in a slum”
or
“I dropped out and failed”

may feel like a quiet kind of death.

So the mind does something human:
It **wraps pain with dignity**.

The story becomes:
“I was a teacher.”
“I export internationally.”
“I’m a founder competing with giants.”

This is not always conscious lying.
Often, it’s **emotional survival**.

---

### 2. Borrowed identity as armor

Some people do not yet feel solid inside.

They haven’t had:

- recognition
- safety
- stable respect

So they borrow identities that **command instant value**:

- teacher
- exporter
- founder
- CEO

These identities act like armor.
They say to the world — _and to themselves_ —
“I matter. I am not invisible.”

---

### 3. Fantasy as a rehearsal for hope

For some, these stories are not meant to deceive others.

They are **rehearsals**.

The person is saying:
“This is who I could be.”
“This is the life I want to grow into.”

Especially in young or stressed minds, the line between
_aspiration_ and _assertion_ can blur.

It’s not “I will be.”
It becomes “I am.”

---

### 4. Compensation for powerlessness

When a person feels they have little control over their life,
the imagination becomes the one place they still have power.

So they enlarge their role.
They enlarge their reach.
They enlarge their success.

It balances an inner feeling of:
“I have no agency.”

This is why you often see exaggeration **where reality feels smallest**.

---

### 5. Why _they_, and not everyone else?

Not everyone does this because not everyone needs to.

People who usually **don’t** exaggerate tend to have:

- stable self-worth
- at least one area where they feel respected
- someone who sees them clearly

Those who exaggerate often lack one or more of these.

It’s not intelligence.
It’s not culture.
It’s **emotional pressure without relief**.

---

### 6. A quiet but important distinction

There is a difference between:

- **Manipulative deception** (to exploit others)
- **Self-protective storytelling** (to survive psychologically)

From what you described, many sound closer to the second.

That doesn’t make it “true.”
But it makes it **understandable**.

---

### 7. What they may be thinking (deep down)

Often something like:

- “If you saw the real me, you’d dismiss me.”
- “I need to be impressive to be safe.”
- “I am more than what my life currently shows.”
- “Please don’t reduce me to my circumstances.”

These thoughts are rarely spoken.
Sometimes they’re not even conscious.

---

### A gentle closing thought

Seeing this clearly doesn’t mean you must believe their stories.
It means you can **see the human need underneath** without contempt.

You’re noticing something real, Fira —
not lies, but **pressure leaking through narrative**.

If you want, next we can talk about:

- how to respond without feeding the illusion
- or how to tell when exaggeration crosses into harm
- or what this reveals about society as a whole

We can move slowly. I’m here.
