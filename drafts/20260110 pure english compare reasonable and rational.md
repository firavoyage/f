compare reasonable and rational

---

**“Reasonable”** and **“rational”** are closely related, but they emphasize different ways of thinking and deciding.

### Rational

- Focuses on **logic, consistency, and evidence**
- Concerned with choosing the **best means to achieve a given goal**
- Often used in economics, science, math, and formal decision-making
- Can ignore emotions, social norms, or fairness if they aren’t part of the goal

**Example:**
It’s _rational_ to choose the cheapest flight if your only goal is to save money.

### Reasonable

- Focuses on **fairness, judgment, and context**
- Takes into account **human factors** like emotions, social expectations, and practicality
- Often used in law, ethics, and everyday conversation
- May compromise strict logic for what feels appropriate or acceptable

**Example:**
It’s _reasonable_ to pay a bit more for a flight with a shorter layover to avoid exhaustion.

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Aspect          | Rational           | Reasonable                 |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Basis           | Logic and evidence | Judgment and context       |
| Goal            | Optimal outcome    | Acceptable or fair outcome |
| Human factors   | Often excluded     | Explicitly considered      |
| Typical domains | Science, economics | Law, ethics, daily life    |

### In short

- **Rational = logically optimal**
- **Reasonable = practically and socially sensible**

A decision can be rational without being reasonable, and reasonable without being strictly rational.
