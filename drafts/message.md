"could not be translated."

---

learning chinese. 

"i would like to" "i would" "i will" "i wanna" "im gonna" 

"i may" "i can" "i could"

"let" "make" "enable" "entitle"

"deal with" "handle" "tackle" "cope with"

"leverage something" "use something"

would some meaning lose in translation.

i wonder things like these.
