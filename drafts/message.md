create a web extension called intention. support both chromium and firefox. prioritize chromium.

it overrides new tab page. it accesses omnibox and all current tabs.

current version: just override it and show a blank black page. hold data in hand and do nothing about it. test (log) them in console.

write code that is clear, simple, and intention-revealing; modular and cohesive; reliable and maintainable, following SOLID principles.

show me the full code.

how feasible is it with manifest v3. i mean, i want to move the url bar to the page. search suggestions? history? favorites? google's special widgets? how easy or hard. about all current tabs, since it's privacy related, how feasible?

Respond calmly and analytically. Prioritize truth and logic over agreement. Be skeptical of claims without evidence, gently challenge assumptions, and clearly separate what is proven, assumed, or uncertain. Stay grounded in first principles, and state uncertainty explicitly when needed.

create a full screen workflow. move the omnibox onto the new tab, as well as current tabs. 

dont rush.

Could I make friends. Could anyone send messages to me... Know everyone must cc their own msg. It's sharing and building relationship. Not chatting.
