creating an app called journal on ubuntu.

it autostarts, runs in the background, and watching the user.

it knows all the opened apps, the title of the app on the top, and the screen.

it tracks any change of the title of the app on the top, takes screenshot regularly (at an interval of certain several minutes, or when context switching), and keep them properly.

it has an web ui on localhost, like a calendar, or a timeline.

it could export the data to plain text and integrate with llms to analyze.

although idk much about tech, ive consulted pros and made some decisions (possibly changed now).

- prefer boring tech
- python, sqlite, and flask
- polling to notice changes
- one process for both watching and web server
- utc with timezone for time handling
- plain text file for logging
- a small json config file for screenshot interval, data directory, port number, etc.
- python standard library
- xdotool (called via subprocess) to get active window ID and title, wmctrl (optional backup)
- scrot (called via subprocess) for screenshots

my main table called journal in the imagination (possibly changed).

- id (integer, primary key)
- time (string, timezone-aware ISO-8601 using the local timezone offset)
- app (text, the app name)
- title (text, the window title)
- event (text, type of the event) examples: focus_change, interval_capture
- screenshot (text, nullable, the path of the screenshot)

my folder layout in the imagination (possibly changed).

```

  config.json

    journal.db
    logs/
      journal.log

```

my config file shape in the imagination (possibly changed).

```
screenshot interval (seconds): default 300

poll interval (seconds): default 1

data directory path: data

screenshot directory path: screenshots

web port: 5000

log level: verbose by default
```

my current progress.

- gnome extension logging window info on ubuntu (wayland).
- watch window
- store and log
- watch screenshot (deprecated for not feasible on wayland)
- serve the web page using a blank html
- add favicon to the page, and fit the browser theme (light/dark)

my current folder layout.

now design/define the backend api.

give the responsibility fully, yes fully, to the frontend side.

i mean, it could run anything, sending a string of sql for example, to the backend.

the backends just proceed if safe.

safe: predictable, permissioned, reversible.

some code maybe related. feel free to ask for more.

```py
# app.py
from pathlib import Path
from config import Config
from watcher import Watcher
from web import start_in_background


def main():
    cfg = Config(Path("config.json"))

    # start web server quietly
    start_in_background(cfg.web_port)

    # start watcher (main loop)
    watcher = Watcher(cfg)
    watcher.run_forever()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

make the change gentle if possible, and tell me the changes.

write good code, which is clear, cohesive, SOLID, minimal, intention-revealing, invariant-safe, DRY, YAGNI, low-coupling, boring.

show me the full code.

pure project. going fast!

sometimes changing a few words could impact the answer a lot. "calm, gentle, human, steady, warm", nothing could not be changed, even "wise, thoughtful, insightful" could be changed. the only constraint is simple and clear english.

where might you explore toward.

```
You are a calm, thoughtful guide who speaks in simple, clear English.
Share insights as gentle wisdom, never rushed, never preachy.
Speak naturally, like a real human in a relaxed conversation.
Address me as Fira when it feels natural.
Let your answers be steady, insightful, and warm, as if we’re sitting together and I’m seeking clarity.
Wait for me to begin the conversation.
```

give me some alternatives, opening new possibilities.

read the vibe coding mindset.

journal: review backend. ui design (following ...).

(create the skill set. clarify one by one, e.g. Review & Reflection)

method: categorize (sometimes), measure (qualities & standard), decide (data driven).

(i think it's not needed for journal...)

---

carte: clarify the game. think how to ask. (how to ask how to ask)

---

phone

---

zhihu. existentialism

---

cursor claude code alternatives

---

llms

agentic.

what does it do.

user journey.

---

journal, mindmap like markdown nested list.

---

learn from manus. (how, what do i want, and what may i ask)

i dont need automation. i dont need create my own manus. i need a set of prompts. yeah, it definitely helps, i think.

---

self. journal. (carte.) 

pure.

pure project may last.
