### "Prefer A to B" (The Traditional Standard)

This is the construction you will find in most traditional grammar guides. It follows the same pattern as other comparative phrases.

- **Structure:** It treats "prefer" as taking an indirect object, similar to "I gave the book **to** her."
- **Connotation:** It states a general, inherent preference.
- **Example:**
  - "I prefer tea **to** coffee." (This is the classic, grammatically prescribed form.)
  - "She prefers reading **to** watching television."
  - "He has always preferred quality **to** quantity."

**When to use it:** This is the safest choice in formal writing, exams, and when you want to adhere to the most traditional grammatical standards.

### "Prefer A over B" (The Modern Challenger)

This construction has become extremely common and is now fully accepted in modern English. It frames the preference as a choice between two competing options.

- **Structure:** It uses "over" in a comparative sense, similar to "I chose option A **over** option B." This makes the act of choosing more explicit.
- **Connotation:** It can carry a slightly stronger sense of **selection and comparison**. It often implies that when weighing the two, A wins.
- **Example:**
  - "For its durability, I prefer this brand **over** that one."
  - "Why would you prefer this complicated method **over** the simpler one?"
  - "In this weather, I'd prefer a cozy blanket **over** a thin sheet."

**When to use it:** Perfectly fine in spoken English, business communication, journalism, and most modern writing. It's often the more natural-sounding choice when the context is about making a clear choice.

### Key Takeaway and Recommendation

1.  **You can use either.** Native speakers use both interchangeably, and you will almost never be misunderstood.
2.  **For formal writing,** if you want to be strictly correct by traditional standards, lean toward **"prefer A to B"**.
3.  **For everyday speech and modern writing,** **"prefer A over B"** is very common and often feels more natural, especially when the preference is based on a direct comparison.

**A note on "than":** You might occasionally hear "prefer A _than_ B" (e.g., "I prefer tea _than_ coffee"). This is generally considered **non-standard and incorrect**. The correct conjunction with "prefer" is "rather than" (e.g., "I would prefer to walk _rather than_ drive").
