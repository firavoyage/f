how to find the playlist of kagura mea

---

Of course! Finding the complete and official playlists for Kagura Mea can be a bit tricky because her content is spread across a few channels, and YouTube's algorithm for organizing past live streams isn't always perfect.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to find her playlists and archives.

### The Primary Method: Her Official YouTube Channels

Kagura Mea's content is primarily hosted on two official YouTube channels:

1.  **Kagura Mea Ch. (Main Channel):** Used for live streams and community posts.
    - **URL:** `youtube.com/@KaguraMea`
2.  **Kagura Mea Archive Ch. (Archive Channel):** Dedicated to storing edited VODs (Video On Demand) of her past live streams.
    - **URL:** `youtube.com/@mea_archive`

Here's how to find the playlists on each:

#### On the Main Channel (@KaguraMea)

1.  Go to her main channel.
2.  Click on the **"Playlists"** tab.
3.  You will find a list of playlists she has created. These are often organized by game or theme.
    - Look for playlists with titles like "[Full] [Game Name]" or series like "Mea's Minecraft".
    - **Important Note:** The main channel's "Playlists" tab might not have a complete archive of _every_ stream, as its primary focus is live streaming.

#### On the Archive Channel (@mea_archive) - **This is your best bet!**

This channel is specifically designed to be a library of her past broadcasts.

1.  Go to the Kagura Mea Archive channel.
2.  Click on the **"Playlists"** tab.
3.  Here, you will find a much more comprehensive and organized collection. The archives are typically sorted by the game she played.
    - You'll see playlists for long series like **"ARK"**, **"Apex Legends"**, **"Minecraft"**, **"Resident Evil"** games, etc.
    - This is the most reliable place to find a full series of streams from start to finish.

---

### Alternative Methods and Tips

If you're looking for a specific stream or a type of content:

- **Use the Search Bar on the Channels:**

  - Go to either the main or archive channel.
  - Use the search bar **at the top of the channel's homepage** and type keywords like the name of the game, "Karaoke," "Zatsudan" (chat stream), or "Mukiroku" (members-only stream). This will filter results to that channel only.

- **Check the "Community" Tab on her Main Channel:**

  - Mea often posts updates, stream announcements, and sometimes links to recent archives here. It can provide context for what she's been playing lately.

- **YouTube Music / Spotify (For Covers):**

  - If you are specifically looking for her song covers, she has some officially released on music platforms.
  - Search for **"Kagura Mea"** on YouTube Music, Spotify, or Apple Music. She has an original song ("Hopeful") and several covers available.

- **Unofficial Compilation/Clip Channels:**
  - There are fan-run channels that create subtitled clips and compilations of her best moments. Searching for **"Kagura Mea clips"** or **"神楽めあ 切り抜き"** (the Japanese term for clips) can help you find highlights, which often link back to the full stream in the description.

---

### **Summary: Your Best Strategy**

1.  **For a complete series of a game:** Go to the **Kagura Mea Archive Ch.** -> **"Playlists"** tab. This is the most organized and reliable source.
2.  **For her latest live streams and community interaction:** Check the **Kagura Mea Ch. (Main Channel)** -> **"Videos"** or **"Live"** tab.
3.  **For a specific video:** Use the **search bar on the respective channel** with relevant keywords.

Please be aware that due to copyright issues with game music and content, some older archives might be unlisted or deleted. The archive channel is the team's effort to preserve as much content as possible within YouTube's guidelines. Enjoy watching!

Of course! This is a great request. It's very common for VTubers like Kagura Mea to have a "core" set of songs they enjoy singing, often from anime, popular Vocaloid hits, and classic J-pop.

Since you can't provide specific songs, I'll put together a playlist of songs that are **very likely** to be in her repertoire or have a very similar style. You can use this as a starting point to find her live performances.

Here is a list of songs, grouped by likelihood, with their names in **English** and **Romaji** (so you can easily copy and paste them into YouTube).

### Tier 1: Highly Likely / Fan Favorites & Common Covers

These are songs that are extremely popular in the VTuber/Vocaloid karaoke scene. If you've heard her sing J-pop, there's a very high chance some of these were in the mix.

Wow, this is an excellent and specific playlist! Thank you for sharing it. This gives a perfect crystal-clear picture of Kagura Mea's taste in cover songs. It's a classic mix of **Vocaloid, anime openings, and modern J-pop/rock**, with a strong emphasis on energetic, emotional, or "otaku-core" hits.

Based on this list, here is a new set of song recommendations that are **extremely likely** to be in her repertoire or will perfectly match the vibe of what you already enjoy. I've organized them by the styles most prevalent in your list.
