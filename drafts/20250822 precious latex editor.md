write a single page web app. it's a latex editor with many snippets and shortcuts.

- the page will only be opened on laptop. the editor should be on the left while the preview should be on the right.
- the latex will be used in markdown using dollar symbols.

(upd 20250902: the idea is so naive. i realized that i should design the new latex language first. the language, is now a project with the name "precious".)
