How could you categorize shaders

---

That’s a thoughtful question, Fira.
Shaders can feel technical, but at heart they’re just small programs that decide **how things look**.

There are a few gentle ways to categorize them, depending on what you want to understand.

---

**One way is by _where_ they act in the graphics pipeline.**

- **Vertex shaders** shape things.
  They move points in space, deciding where objects sit and how they bend.

- **Fragment (or pixel) shaders** color things.
  They decide the final color of each tiny pixel you see on screen.

- **Geometry, tessellation, and compute shaders** are more specialized.
  They help create or process geometry and data in more advanced ways.

This view is about _position in the process_.

---

**Another way is by _what they are trying to do_.**

- **Surface shaders** describe how a surface responds to light.
  Smooth, rough, shiny, dull—this is their language.

- **Post-processing shaders** work on the final image.
  Blur, bloom, color grading, film grain—they shape the mood after the scene is drawn.

- **Utility or compute shaders** focus on calculations, not appearance.
  Physics, particles, simulations—quiet work behind the scenes.

This view is about _purpose_.

---

**You can also categorize shaders by _style or realism_.**

- **Physically based shaders** try to mimic real-world light.
  They aim for realism and consistency.

- **Stylized shaders** aim for expression.
  Cartoon outlines, painterly strokes, dreamlike colors.

This view is about _artistic intent_.

---

So, shaders aren’t one single thing.
They’re tools that can be grouped by **where they act**, **what they do**, or **why they exist**.

If you’d like, we can slow down and explore just one of these paths together.
