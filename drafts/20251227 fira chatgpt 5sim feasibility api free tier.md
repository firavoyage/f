search online. find out whether it's feasible, or how feasible, to create some chatgpt accounts with 5sim. i dont need a lot for automation. what would register chatgpt take, just a phone?

---

_Here’s what I found online, Fira, laid out gently so you can sense whether this feels doable or not:_

### 🌿 What the SMS-service sites themselves say

5sim and similar services let you **get temporary virtual phone numbers online** that can receive an SMS verification code for a service like ChatGPT. You pick the **service (e.g., OpenAI/ChatGPT)**, pay a small fee, and then you get a number you can use _just to receive the verification SMS_ during registration. ([5SIM][1])

That’s basically the core idea:
• You don’t need a physical SIM card, just internet. ([5SIM][2])
• You buy or rent a number, copy it into the sign-up form, and retrieve the SMS code back from 5sim. ([5SIM][1])

### 🌱 How feasible it is in practice

The method _can_ work — many people online talk about using virtual numbers from services like 5sim or others to sign up for online accounts that require SMS verification. ([5SIM][2])

But there’s a gentle caveat:

- **Sometimes platforms block virtual or VoIP numbers.** Some sites detect and reject these temporary phone numbers as part of fraud prevention. People report that ChatGPT/OpenAI may _not_ accept certain virtual numbers or VoIP services — saying the number is not valid. ([Reddit][3])
- Experiences vary a lot depending on how the platform’s verification system changes over time and how the SMS service’s numbers are seen by that platform’s systems.

### 🧠 What people online discuss

From what others share in forums:
• A virtual number can work for OpenAI if it’s not flagged as _VoIP_. ([Reddit][4])
• Some people report it **didn’t work at all** with ChatGPT because the platform rejected the number. ([Reddit][5])
• And some mention that you may run into **IP or device-related checks** if you try creating multiple accounts in a short span. Proxy or VPN use is often recommended there. ([5sim][6])

### 💭 In simple terms

If you’re thinking: _“All I need is a phone?”_ — technically for OpenAI’s account creation you need **a phone number that can receive SMS verification**. That’s the main requirement. How that number is provided — whether from a real SIM card or a virtual service — is mostly up to OpenAI’s verification systems, not just you. ([Online Tech Tips][7])

Virtual number services like 5sim make the _phone number_ part easier. But they don’t guarantee acceptance by every platform, and some platforms are more strict than others.

### ✨ So, how feasible is it?

Peacefully put, it’s **possible in many cases**, but:

- **Not universally reliable:** sometimes the code arrives, sometimes the platform won’t accept the number.
- **Not guaranteed for mass creation:** platforms may detect multiple sign-ups and block you.
- **Costs and quality vary:** better numbers cost a bit more, cheaper ones may fail. ([5SIM][2])

If you want a soft test, you could try just one virtual number first and see if it gets accepted — that way you feel into the process gently.

Whenever you’re ready, I can walk through the practical steps with you, or talk about alternatives too. 🌿

search online. and what about chatgpt side. what does it take for registering an account, is phone enough. what does the community say.

---

Here’s what I gently found about **what OpenAI (ChatGPT) _really_ wants when you register**, and what people in the community are saying about it — in a calm, clear way, Fira 🌿:

---

### 🌱 1. **Official requirement right now: phone _not always needed_**

According to OpenAI’s own help documents, **you no longer need to verify with a phone number just to create a ChatGPT account for general use**. That means:

- You can sign up with **email, Google, Microsoft, or Apple** without phone verification for basic ChatGPT access. ([OpenAI Help Center][1])

This is a recent openness in their policy — the phone number _used to be mandatory_, but isn’t anymore for **just creating an account**.

---

### 📞 2. **Phone may still show up for security or API**

Even though you can sign up without phone number now:

- OpenAI \*still requires a phone when you create your **first API key\*** (that’s different from a ChatGPT login). ([OpenAI Help Center][1])
- Some users still see a phone prompt during signup depending on region or version of the flow they hit.

So, in practice, the site might show a phone step — but it’s **not strictly required for basic ChatGPT use** in many places.

---

### 🌍 3. **Phone-only signup experiment**

There’s a **beta feature in some countries** where you can sign up using only a phone number, with no email at all. But it has limitations:

- You can’t upgrade to Plus/Pro without linking an email later. ([TechCrunch][2])

This shows OpenAI is testing different approaches, but the core experience still expects an email for full use.

---

### 🧠 4. **Community experience: phone numbers are finicky**

People talking online have noticed these patterns:

- **Virtual numbers often get rejected (“virtual/VoIP not valid”)** when SMS is demanded. ([Reddit][3])
- Some report that certain numbers _never get the SMS code sent_, or they get blocked as “potential abuse.” ([Reddit][4])
- Others have had issues with regional limitations or service not available in specific countries. ([Reddit][5])

So even when phone is asked for, **the type of number matters a lot** — real mobile numbers tend to work better than virtual ones, according to user talk.

---

### 📌 5. **Limits on how many accounts per phone**

There’s a note in Japanese community discussion (not official, but reflective of user knowledge) that **each phone number can only be linked to a small number of accounts (like 2)**, and this doesn’t reset quickly even if accounts are deleted. ([Qiita][6])

This matches how many platforms treat reuse of phone numbers for verification — it’s a **safety and anti-abuse measure.**

---

### 🍃 **In soft, steady summary**

Here’s how it gently looks, Fira:

- 📬 **Officially**: You _can_ register ChatGPT without phone in many countries using email or social login. ([OpenAI Help Center][1])
- 📞 **Phone may still be asked** in some flows, especially depending on region or features like API access. ([OpenAI Help Center][1])
- ☎️ **People online report** that virtual numbers (like those from SMS-for-web services) **often get rejected** or fail to receive codes. ([Reddit][3])
- 🔁 **Phone reuse limits** exist to slow down multiple account creation. ([Qiita][6])

---

If your goal is something like multiple accounts for automation, this means you might gently bump into these routines that aim to keep registrations tied to a few _real, unique identities_ — not much different from many web services.

Whenever you want, we can explore **how people actually handle these flows step-by-step**, or look at alternatives for verification, in a way that feels right for you. 🌿

how much is offical openai chatgpt api limitation for free plan.

---

Thanks for the gentle pause, Fira. Here’s a warm, clear picture of the **OpenAI (ChatGPT) API and its free-usage situation as it stands now** — gathered from community and official threads online.

---

### 🌱 **Is there a true free API tier right now?**

It **feels like OpenAI has moved away from a completely free API tier** for new users — at least for typical developer use:

- New API sign-ups **do not automatically get large free credits anymore** — the old $18 trial credits that used to be common have been mostly discontinued for new users. ([FastGPTPlus][1])
- Many developers online report that you must **add a payment method and pre-pay at least a small amount (often ~$5) to start using the API**. ([Reddit][2])
- Without those credits, **you won’t be able to make many API calls before running into quota or billing**. ([OpenAI Developer Community][3])

In other words, the API is realistically a **pay-as-you-go service, not a free tier you can use indefinitely**.

---

### 🌟 **What you _might_ get when you sign up**

Some recent reports say:

- Some accounts do receive a **small initial credit (around $5)** that lasts for a few months, which lets you experiment with calls before paying more. ([CostGoat][4])
- These credits are limited and **expire after a short time (often ~3 months)**. ([CostGoat][4])
- After that, or if you don’t receive credits, **you’re billed per token used** according to the model pricing on OpenAI’s official pricing page. ([OpenAI Platform][5])

But the consensus from community discussions is gentle but clear: **there’s no permanent free usage credit for the API anymore** — it’s tied to trial credits and then pay-for-what-you-use. ([OpenAI Developer Community][6])

---

### 🧠 **Rate limits and tiers**

There _used to be_ and in some documentation still are mentions of _rate limits_ on usage to prevent overuse, but these are tied to your **billing tier**, not a free quota:

- Without adding payment info, you often quickly hit **insufficient_quota errors**, meaning you can’t continue API calls. ([Reddit][7])
- Paid usage unlocks higher “**Usage Tier**” limits where you can make more API calls before hitting rate limits or spend caps. ([OpenAI Platform][8])

So, your experience depends a lot on whether you add payment and purchase credits.

---

### 🌼 **In softer terms, Fira**

Right now, if you’re hoping to build something and play with the **ChatGPT API without paying anything** forever — that’s not really how it’s set up at the moment.

OpenAI has shifted the API toward a **paid, token-based system**, where:

- You might **get a small amount of free credits when you first sign up** (for example, about $5 worth), but they _expire_ and aren’t guaranteed. ([CostGoat][4])
- After that, you **pay for each call you make** based on how many tokens it uses. ([OpenAI Platform][5])
- There’s no long-term free-for-all tier like you might find in some other APIs — it’s more meant for development and production with a budget. ([OpenAI Developer Community][6])

This approach helps make sure the powerful models stay stable and available to everyone while still letting curious developers explore them with a small test budget.

---

If you’d like, we can also gently step through **how the billing works** and what costs to expect per token or per model — that can help you feel into what would be affordable for your project. 🌿
