shadowverse rule

---

Of course! Here is a comprehensive overview of the core rules of **Shadowverse**, the digital collectible card game.

---

### **The Ultimate Goal**

The goal is simple: reduce your opponent's **Leader Defense** (starting at 20) to zero. You can also win if your opponent cannot draw a card when required (a "deck-out").

---

### **1. Core Concepts & Setup**

- **Deck:** You build a deck of exactly **40 cards** before a match.
- **Leader:** You choose a **Leader** (and corresponding class) for the match. Your Leader determines the unique cards and playstyle you can use.
- **Play Point (PP) System:** This is your resource for playing cards. You start with 1 PP on your first turn, and it increases by 1 each turn, up to a maximum of 10. Unused PP does not carry over.
- **The Board:** The game is played on a board with 5 spaces on each side for Followers.

---

### **2. Turn Structure**

Each player's turn follows this sequence:

1.  **Draw Phase:** Draw one card from your deck.
2.  **Play Point Refresh:** Your PP gauge is filled to its maximum for that turn.
3.  **Main Phase:** You can perform any and all of the following actions in any order:
    - Play Followers, Amulets, and Spells from your hand by paying their cost.
    - Attack with your Followers.
    - Use your Leader's **Evolve** ability (if available).
    - Use any effects on cards in play.
4.  **End Phase:** Your turn ends, and your opponent's turn begins.

---

### **3. Card Types**

- **Followers:** These are your creatures/minions that stay on the board. They have:

  - **Cost (PP):** The Play Point cost to summon them.
  - **Attack:** How much damage they deal.
  - **Defense (HP):** How much damage they can take before being destroyed.
  - **Abilities:** Special effects (e.g., **Storm** = Can attack immediately, **Ward** = Protects your Leader from attacks).

- **Spells:** One-time effect cards. After the effect resolves, the Spell is sent to the graveyard.

- **Amulets:** These are permanents that stay on the board and provide ongoing effects or have a **Countdown**. A Countdown amulet is destroyed after the specified number of your turns.

---

### **4. Combat**

- **Attacking Followers:** You can choose for your Followers to attack the opponent's Leader or their Followers.
- **Battle Resolution:** When Followers battle, they deal damage equal to their Attack to each other simultaneously.
- **Exhaustion:** After a Follower attacks or is played, it becomes **Exhausted** (tapped) and cannot attack again until your next turn.

---

### **5. The Evolution System (A Core Mechanic)**

Evolution is a crucial, game-changing mechanic that becomes available starting on **Turn 4** (for the player who goes second) and **Turn 5** (for the player who goes first).

- **What it does:** You can **Evolve** a Follower on your turn. This grants it:
  - +2/+2 to its Attack and Defense (for one turn only).
  - The ability to attack immediately (like **Storm**).
  - It also "refreshes" the Follower, allowing it to attack even if it already has.
- **Evolution Points (EP):**
  - The player who goes **first** gets **2 Evolution Points**.
  - The player who goes **second** gets **3 Evolution Points** (to help balance the advantage of going first).
- **Using an Evolution:** You can only Evolve once per turn (unless a card effect says otherwise). You can also Evolve on the turn a Follower is played.

---

### **6. Key Keywords & Abilities**

Knowing these common keywords is essential:

- **Ward:** Opponent's attacks must target this Follower first. The ultimate defensive tool.
- **Storm:** Can attack the turn it is played. The key to aggressive and combo decks.
- **Rush:** Can attack enemy Followers the turn it is played, but not the enemy Leader.
- **Bane:** Destroys any Follower it damages.
- **Fanfare:** An effect that activates when the card is played from your hand.
- **Last Words:** An effect that activates when the card is destroyed or sacrificed.
- **Clash:** Activates when the Follower attacks or is attacked and deals damage.
- **Necromancy:** An effect that consumes shadows (cards in your graveyard) for an additional effect.
- **Invocation:** A special effect that automatically puts a card from your deck into play, without being played from your hand.

---

### **7. Mulligan (Starting Hand)**

At the beginning of the game, you draw 3 cards. You can choose any number of them to shuffle back into your deck and redraw. This is your chance to find low-cost cards for the early game.

---

### **8. Crafting & Deckbuilding (The "Rule" of Collection Management)**

While not a game rule, a fundamental rule for playing Shadowverse long-term is the **Card Crafting System**.

- **Vials:** The resource used to create cards. You get them by liquefying (destroying) cards you don't want.
- **Rarity Tiers:** Cards come in Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Legendary rarities. Legendaries are the most powerful and most expensive to craft.
- **The Golden Rule:** **Do not randomly craft cards!** Always have a specific, proven decklist in mind and craft towards that. This prevents you from wasting precious vials on cards you won't use.

### **Summary Flow of a Typical Game**

- **Turns 1-3:** The "early game." Players establish their board with low-cost Followers and trade damage.
- **Turn 4/5:** The "mid-game" begins with the Evolution turn. The board state can change dramatically as players use Evolutions to gain advantage.
- **Turns 6-10:** The "late game." Players use their high-cost, powerful cards to push for victory or stabilize the board. Combos are often set up here.
- **Turn 10+:** Players are at maximum PP. The game is often decided by top-decking powerful cards or executing a game-ending combo.

This covers the vast majority of what you need to know to start playing Shadowverse. Good luck, and have fun

| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Super Evolution**           | Uses separate **SEP (Super Evolution Points)**. Grants +3/+3, **Rush**, damage/effect immunity on own turn. Defeating enemy followers deals 1 extra damage to enemy leader. | Increases strategic depth and provides visually impactful, game-changing moments.           |
| **Extra PP**                  | For balance, the **second player** gains 1 extra PP at specific times (once by turn 5 end, once from turn 6 start).                                                         | Mitigates the first-player advantage inherent in card games.                                |
| **Evolution System Changes**  | Both players start with 2 **EP (Evolution Points)**. Evolution grants a fixed +2/+2. EP and SEP are separate resources.                                                     | Simplifies resource management and makes evolution outcomes more predictable.               |
| **New Profession: Nightmare** | Merges the previous **Necromancer** and **Vampire** classes into a single new class.                                                                                        | Improves class balance and addresses long-term balancing challenges from the original game. |

### üÉè Core Gameplay and New Player Experience

Beyond the new rules, _Worlds Beyond_ features several systems designed to make the game more enjoyable and easier to start.

After completing tutorial missions, you can **choose one of nine pre-built decks** that include Legendary cards to start playing immediately . A "Card Encyclopedia" feature enhances card collection satisfaction .

- **Shadowverse Park**: This is a new social space where players can interact, communicate, and participate in various activities together, fostering a stronger community .

### üéÆ Development Vision and Forthcoming Content

According to interviews with the producers, the development team had clear goals for _Worlds Beyond_.

- **A Fresh Start for a New Generation**: The team created a new app instead of simply updating the original _Shadowverse_ to overcome technical limitations of the old client and ensure the game's evolution for the next 20-30 years . The dual operation of both the original and the new game allows each to serve different player needs .
- **Focus on eSports**: _Worlds Beyond_ continues Cygames' commitment to competitive play. The game is designed with strategic depth for high-level competition, supported by plans for international tournaments with significant prize pools .
- **Future Content Schedule**: The release schedule for new card packs in _Worlds Beyond_ is more frequent than in the original game. While each new set is smaller, the total number of cards released per year will be similar, aiming to keep the meta-game fresh without overwhelming players .
