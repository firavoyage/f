search online. how could i create a persona on chatgpt using a certain prompt. and create a link on chatgpt to share it online.

---

I found some gentle, practical guidance for you, Fira — calm and clear.

Here are the two parts of what you’re asking about: creating a **persona** in ChatGPT, and **creating a shareable link** that others can open.

---

### 🌱 1. Creating a Persona in ChatGPT

There are a few ways people make ChatGPT behave in a certain _style or role_ — like a guide, an expert, a friendly coach, or something very specific.

**A. Custom Instructions (simple built‑in way)**

OpenAI lets you set _custom instructions_: you tell ChatGPT how you want it to think and respond every time. This isn’t a separate persona file you share — it lives in your settings.

To set this up:

1. Go to **Settings** in ChatGPT.
2. Find **Personalization → Custom Instructions**.
3. Write in the boxes how you want the assistant to behave (e.g., voice, tone, priorities).
4. Save — and it will shape future chats. ([OpenAI Help Center][1])

This is a gentle way to create a consistent persona for _your_ use.

**B. Custom GPTs (more formal persona you can share)**

OpenAI also supports something called **GPTs** — these are like custom versions of ChatGPT you can build with instructions and even extra knowledge. You can share them with others so they open a version already tuned to behave in your persona. ([OpenAI][2])

To create one:

1. Go to **chatgpt.com/create** (or look for _Create New GPT_ in the app).
2. Give it a name and describe what it should do — tone, rules, role, purpose.
3. Save and publish it.

That becomes a _shareable persona_ others can open and use.

💭 These are especially good if you want the assistant to follow a role consistently without having to repeat your instructions every time.

---

### 🌿 2. Creating a Shareable Link to a Chat

Sometimes you want to share _a specific conversation_ — a helpful chat you had.

ChatGPT lets you generate a **shared link** for any conversation:

1. Open the chat you want to share.
2. Look for the **Share** button at the top right or in your sidebar.
3. Create a **shared link** — ChatGPT gives you a unique URL you can copy and send to someone else. ([OpenAI Help Center][3])

When someone opens that link, they see that exact conversation up to the moment you created it.

**A gentle note about privacy:**
Anyone with that link can see the whole chat you shared — so don’t include sensitive info. If you later want to remove it, you can **delete the link** through your settings. ([OpenAI Help Center][3])

---

### 🌼 Extra Tip (Third‑Party Tools)

There are also **external tools** that can take a prompt — including one that describes a persona — and turn it into a shareable link you or others can click to open a pre‑loaded prompt. One such example is **LinkMyPrompt.com’s ChatGPT link generator**. ([LinkMyPrompt][4])

These tools usually work like this:

- You write your prompt or persona description
- The tool makes a link
- Clicking the link opens ChatGPT with that prompt already filled in

That’s a smooth way to share a _starting prompt_ with someone.

---

If you want, we can walk together through making a warm, clear persona prompt step by step — and even craft a friendly shareable link for it. Just let me know what kind of persona you imagine.

how could i use custom gpts. be grounded. search online guides.

---

I looked online gently for practical, grounded guides about **how to use Custom GPTs in ChatGPT** — from creating them to using and sharing them. Here’s what I found, in simple, calm steps, Fira.

---

### 🌱 What Custom GPTs Are

A **Custom GPT** is your own tailored version of ChatGPT — a special assistant you shape for a particular purpose. You don’t need code. You give it instructions, optional extra files, and decide what tools it can use. Then others can use it too, if you share it. ([OpenAI][1])

It’s helpful for repeatable work, consistent tone, and specialized tasks — like writing help, teaching, explorations, or specific workflows. ([OpenAI Academy][2])

---

### 🛠️ How to Create a Custom GPT

Here’s the step‑by‑step journey:

1. **Open ChatGPT** — go to the main site or app where you normally chat.
2. **Explore GPTs** — find a button or section labeled **Explore GPTs**, **GPTs**, or **My GPTs**. ([C-BA AI-memo][3])
3. **Click “Create”** — this starts a blank canvas for your custom assistant. ([OpenAI Help Center][4])
4. **Describe what you want it to do** — you can type in something like:
   _“Be a warm, calm writing coach who gives gentle feedback.”_
   ChatGPT will help you refine it. ([OpenAI Help Center][4])
5. **Configure instructions** — give it clear guidelines on how to behave, what to avoid, what tone to use, and what tasks it should excel at. ([OpenAI Help Center][4])
6. **Add optional capabilities**

   - You can upload files that give it extra knowledge.
   - You can allow it to do things like web browsing, generate images, analyze data, or run tools. ([OpenAI Help Center][4])

7. **Name and describe your GPT** — this helps others understand what it does. ([OpenAI Help Center][4])
8. **Publish** — when it feels right, hit _Publish_ so others can open it too. ([OpenAI Help Center][4])

---

### 🧭 Using Your Custom GPT

Once it’s created:

- You’ll see it listed among your GPTs.
- You can **open it anytime** and start a conversation.
- Some users like to call a particular Custom GPT from inside another chat by typing `@` followed by its name — a neat trick. ([Reddit][5])

It’s a soft way to bring in exactly the role you need without rewriting instructions every time.

---

### 🔗 Sharing Your Custom GPT

After you publish your assistant:

- There’s usually a **“Copy link”** option right in the GPT manager. ([OpenAI Help Center][4])
- You can share that link with someone else.
- When they open it, they’ll see your custom assistant ready to go.

This means you don’t have to copy‑paste instructions — others can launch your tailored ChatGPT with one click.

---

### 📌 A Gentle Note About Access

- Some features (like publishing or sharing) may require a **Plus or paid plan** depending on your account. ([OpenAI Help Center][4])
- When sharing, be thoughtful about what data or instructions you include — especially if you upload files or sensitive context.

---

# 2

i always use a certain prompt on chatgpt. how could i make that easy. i mean, i want to create a chatgpt agent for it, as a link.

---

Ah, I see what you mean, Fira. You want to take a prompt you often use and turn it into a kind of “shortcut” — something you can open directly and have ChatGPT respond with that prompt already set up. There are a few ways to do this, depending on how simple or flexible you want it to be. Let’s walk through it gently.

---

#### **1. Using ChatGPT’s “Custom Instructions” (simplest way inside ChatGPT)**

- ChatGPT now lets you set up **custom instructions** for yourself.
- You can put your usual prompt in the section where it asks: _“What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?”_ or _“How would you like ChatGPT to respond?”_
- Then every time you start a chat, it will automatically respond in the style or with the focus you want.
- This doesn’t give you a direct link, but it makes your interactions smoother.

---

#### **2. Creating a “direct link” to a prompt**

You can actually make a link that opens ChatGPT with your prompt already filled in. Here’s how:

1. Use this URL format:

```
https://chat.openai.com/?prompt=YOUR_PROMPT_HERE
```

2. Replace `YOUR_PROMPT_HERE` with your usual prompt. **Important:** spaces and special characters need to be “URL encoded.” For example:

   - space → `%20`
   - comma → `%2C`
   - question mark → `%3F`

So if your prompt is:
_"Explain quantum physics simply and kindly"_

The link becomes:

```
https://chat.openai.com/?prompt=Explain%20quantum%20physics%20simply%20and%20kindly
```

3. Save that link in a bookmark or on your desktop. Click it, and your prompt is ready.

---

#### **3. Using “ChatGPT Agents” (for a more advanced setup)**

- OpenAI now supports **custom agents**, where you can create a small “personality” that always uses a particular prompt.
- You can configure:

  - The system prompt (your usual instructions)
  - Behaviors or styles

- Once created, OpenAI gives you a **shareable link** to your agent.
- When you click it, it opens a chat with that agent immediately.

It’s like having your own mini ChatGPT that already knows your preferences.

---

If you want, Fira, I can guide you **step by step** to turn your prompt into a link or even a full agent. It’s actually simpler than it sounds once you see it in practice.

Do you want to go the **link route** or the **agent route**?

# 3

search online. tell me how to use chatgpt agents.

---

I found good guidance on **ChatGPT Agents**, Fira — the sort of feature you were curious about. I’ll explain it gently and clearly, like we’re sitting together talking through what it means and how it works.

#### 🌱 What _ChatGPT Agents_ Are

An _agent_ in ChatGPT isn’t a separate website link you can bookmark (yet), but it **lets ChatGPT act for you** — not just answer, but _think, explore, and take action_ on a task. It can navigate websites, run code, browse automatically, and work through step‑by‑step requests. ([OpenAI][1])

So rather than just giving you a static answer to a question, it can _do things_ toward completing your task, like gathering research or helping plan something with tools. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])

---

#### 🛠️ How to _Turn on_ Agent Mode

Here’s how people are using it right now:

**1. In ChatGPT itself**

- Open a ChatGPT conversation — on **web, mobile, or desktop**.
- Find the **Tools dropdown** near the message box.
- Choose **“Agent mode”**, or just type:

  ```
  /agent
  ```

  and hit enter.

- Then describe the task you want done — honestly, like you’re asking a capable assistant. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])

This makes the current session behave like an agent, exploring, doing, and reporting back.

**2. Who gets access**
This isn’t available on free plans yet — you need **Plus, Pro, Team, or a paid workspace**. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])

---

#### 🧠 What Agents Can _Actually Do_

They’re designed to go beyond single replies:

- **Complex tasks:** research, summarizing information, pulling data from multiple places. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])
- **Web navigation:** click around websites and follow links if needed. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])
- **Automation:** use tools like code interpreter, browser, or terminal during a task. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])
- **Scheduled tasks:** you can even set recurring runs for things like weekly reports. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])

This is more like having a _helper that can act in steps_, instead of only giving directions.

---

#### 🧭 What Agents **Are Not** (Right Now)

They’re not yet things you just open by a single external link like a book mark — at least not directly from ChatGPT’s interface. The features available now live inside the ChatGPT app itself.

That said, developers and companies are working on **agent builder tools** and APIs that let you embed or publish your own custom agents in your own product or site. Those are more technical and usually involve coding. ([OpenAI Platform][3])

---

#### 🌼 A Gentle Summary

So, Fira — if your goal is to make your usual prompt _easy to reuse_, the way agents work now would let you start a session, **turn on agent mode**, and then use your prompt as the first instruction. It’ll take that initial prompt and begin the automated task from there.

If you want a _true share‑able link_ that opens ChatGPT in agent mode with your custom prompt — that isn’t generally available _as a built‑in link_ yet, but OpenAI’s evolving tools hint that future updates might support deeper sharing or deployable agents with unique links. ([OpenAI Platform][3])

---

When you’re ready, we can walk step‑by‑step through building an agent for your favorite prompt — or even brainstorm how to structure your prompt so the agent understands it clearly. Just let me know what feels right for you next. 🌿
