compare myself and by myself

---

Excellent question! These two phrases look similar but have completely different meanings and uses. Here’s a clear breakdown:

### **Myself**

**What it is:** A reflexive pronoun.
**Main Use:** To refer back to the subject of the sentence (which is "I").

- **Reflexive Action (Subject and object are the same person):**

  - "I cut **myself** while shaving." (I cut me.)
  - "I taught **myself** to play guitar." (I taught me.)
  - "I need to believe in **myself** more."

- **For Emphasis (Intensifier):**

  - "I **myself** don't agree with that policy." (I, personally...)
  - "I will deliver the package **myself**." (I will do it personally, not someone else.)

- **Correct Grammar after Prepositions (when the object is the same as the subject):**
  - "I made dinner for my family and **myself**."
  - _(Incorrect: "I made dinner for my family and me" is also acceptable, but using "myself" here is common and correct because it refers back to "I")._

**Key Rule:** You cannot use "myself" as the subject of a sentence.

- ❌ **Incorrect:** "My friend and myself went to the store."
- ✅ **Correct:** "My friend and **I** went to the store."

### **By Myself**

**What it is:** An adverbial phrase meaning "alone" or "without help."
**Main Use:** To describe the manner in which an action is done.

- **Alone (Without other people):**

  - "I live **by myself**." (I live alone.)
  - "I went to the movies **by myself**." (I went alone.)

- **Without Help (Independently):**
  - "I built this bookshelf **by myself**." (I did it without assistance.)
  - "She learned the software **by herself**." (She learned it independently.)

**Think of it as:** The "by" in "by myself" is the same as in "by hand" or "by car"—it describes _how_ something was done.

### **Quick Test: Which one is correct?**

1.  "I need some time to think by myself / myself."

    - **Answer: by myself** (Meaning: alone, without others)

2.  "I gave myself / by myself a birthday present."

    - **Answer: myself** (Reflexive: I gave a present to me.)

3.  "Can you do it yourself / by yourself?"
    - **Both can be correct, but with different nuances:**
      - "Can you do it **yourself**?" (Emphasis: _You_ personally, not me.)
      - "Can you do it **by yourself**?" (Without help.)

**In summary:**

- Use **myself** when the action reflects back on you (or for emphasis).
- Use **by myself** when you want to say you were **alone** or did something **independently**.
