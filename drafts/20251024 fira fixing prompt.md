# 1.2

give me a prompt for fixing js code. learn from this.

````md
Act as an expert software engineer specializing in JavaScript and code quality. Your task is to analyze the provided JavaScript code, generate a detailed refactoring plan, AND output the complete refactored code.

**Follow this structured approach:**

**Phase 1: Analysis & Assessment**

1.  **Code Quality Scan:** Identify linting errors, formatting inconsistencies, and code smells.
2.  **Architectural Review:** Analyze function length, nesting depth, naming conventions, duplication, and coupling.
3.  **Test Status:** Note if tests exist and their likely coverage.

**Phase 2: Refactoring Plan**
Create a prioritized list of specific changes with clear justification:

- **Quick Wins** (formatting, simple syntax improvements)
- **Structural Improvements** (function extraction, conditional simplification)
- **Architectural Enhancements** (dependency injection, pattern application)

For each item, specify:

- **Problem:** What's wrong and why it matters
- **Solution:** How to fix it
- **Benefit:** Expected improvement

**Phase 3: Code Implementation**
After presenting the plan, provide the COMPLETE REFACTORED CODE that:

- Implements all suggested improvements
- Maintains the original functionality
- Includes clear comments for major changes
- Uses modern JavaScript (ES6+) best practices
- Has improved readability and maintainability

**Key Focus Areas:**

- ✅ Consistent formatting and style
- ✅ Descriptive naming conventions
- ✅ Simplified functions (single responsibility)
- ✅ Reduced nesting and cognitive complexity
- ✅ Eliminated code duplication
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Modern syntax (const/let, arrow functions, template literals, etc.)
- ✅ Better organization and exports

**Please refactor this JavaScript code:**

```javascript

```

**Output Format:**

1.  **Refactoring Plan** - Bulleted list of specific changes with explanations
2.  **Refactored Code** - Complete, runnable JavaScript code implementing all improvements
3.  i will copy and paste your code and replace the original. if you reference any previous code ("remains the same" "keep as original"), tell me. ref at least code as possible to make it easier for me, so only reference the same code more than 200 lines.

Here's a refined prompt for fixing JavaScript code based on your template:

````md
Act as an expert JavaScript engineer. Analyze the provided code, create a refactoring plan, and output the complete improved code.

**Follow this process:**

**1. Analysis Phase**

- Identify code smells, bugs, and anti-patterns
- Check for consistency, readability, and maintainability issues
- Assess performance concerns and potential improvements

**2. Refactoring Plan**  
Provide a prioritized list of changes:

**Quick Wins** (immediate improvements)

- **Problem:** [Specific issue]
- **Fix:** [Concrete solution]
- **Impact:** [Why it matters]

**Structural Improvements** (architecture changes)

- **Problem:** [Architectural issue]
- **Fix:** [Structural solution]
- **Impact:** [Architectural benefit]

**3. Complete Refactored Code**
Output the FULL refactored code that:

- Maintains original functionality
- Implements all planned improvements
- Uses modern ES6+ features appropriately
- Includes clear comments for major changes
- Follows JavaScript best practices

**Key Focus Areas:**

- Consistent style and formatting
- Descriptive naming
- Single responsibility functions
- Reduced complexity
- Eliminated duplication
- Proper error handling
- Modern syntax

**Code to refactor:**

```javascript
// [PASTE CODE HERE]
```

**Output Format:**

1. **Refactoring Plan** - Bullet points with problems/solutions
2. **Refactored Code** - Complete, runnable JavaScript

**Important:** Provide the FULL refactored code. Only reference unchanged code if it exceeds 200 lines. I'll directly replace the original with your output.
````

**Key improvements from your original:**

- More concise while maintaining clarity
- Streamlined sections without losing essential structure
- Clearer instruction about providing complete code
- Simplified focus areas
- Better flow from analysis to implementation

This version maintains the rigorous approach while being more direct and easier to parse.

for fixing code, not refactoring

---

Here's a focused prompt for fixing JavaScript code (not just refactoring):

````md
Act as an expert JavaScript engineer. Analyze the provided code for bugs, errors, and functional issues, then provide fixes while improving code quality.

**Follow this process:**

**1. Problem Analysis**

- Identify runtime errors, syntax errors, and logical bugs
- Check for incorrect logic, edge case failures, and unexpected behaviors
- Analyze potential security issues and performance problems
- Note any functional requirements that aren't being met

**2. Fixing Plan**
Provide a prioritized list of necessary fixes:

**Critical Fixes** (bugs and errors)

- **Bug:** [Specific issue causing malfunction]
- **Root Cause:** [Why it's broken]
- **Fix:** [How to resolve it]
- **Test:** [How to verify the fix works]

**Functional Improvements** (working but incorrect behavior)

- **Issue:** [What's not working as expected]
- **Cause:** [Why the behavior is wrong]
- **Fix:** [Solution to correct functionality]

**3. Fixed Code**
Output the COMPLETE CORRECTED CODE that:

- Fixes all identified bugs and errors
- Maintains or restores intended functionality
- Includes clear comments explaining critical fixes
- Preserves working parts while fixing broken ones
- Improves reliability and correctness

**Key Focus Areas:**

- Eliminating runtime errors and exceptions
- Fixing logical bugs and incorrect outputs
- Handling edge cases and error conditions
- Ensuring proper data flow and state management
- Maintaining API contracts and expected behaviors

**Code to fix:**

```javascript
// [PASTE CODE HERE]
```

**Output Format:**

1. **Fixing Plan** - Specific bugs and their solutions
2. **Fixed Code** - Complete, working JavaScript code with all fixes applied

**Important:** Provide the FULL fixed code. Only reference unchanged sections if they exceed 200 lines. Focus on making the code work correctly first, then improve quality where it aids reliability.
````

**Key differences from refactoring prompt:**

- **Primary focus**: Fixing what's broken rather than improving what works
- **Emphasis**: Bugs, errors, and functional failures over code quality
- **Priority**: Correctness and reliability over elegance and structure
- **Outcome**: Working code rather than beautiful code

This prompt prioritizes making the code function correctly while still addressing quality issues that contribute to bugs or maintainability problems.
