"what should good software engineering be" is it grammatically correct

---

Excellent question.

Yes, the sentence **"What should good software engineering be?" is grammatically correct.**

Here's a breakdown of why:

- **"What"**: The interrogative pronoun, acting as the subject complement (the thing the subject should be).
- **"should"**: The modal verb, expressing obligation or ideal state.
- **"good software engineering"**: The subject of the sentence. "Software engineering" is a compound noun, and "good" is an adjective modifying it.
- **"be"**: The main verb in its infinitive form, which is required after a modal verb like "should."

The structure follows the standard pattern for a question: **Question Word (What) + Modal Verb (should) + Subject (good software engineering) + Main Verb (be).**

### How It's Used

While grammatically correct, this phrasing is somewhat philosophical and open-ended. It's the kind of question you would ask to start a deep discussion about principles and ideals.

You are more likely to hear these slight variations in different contexts:

- **As a complete, philosophical question:**
  - "What should good software engineering be? Is it about speed, reliability, or maintainability?"
- **As a dependent clause in a longer sentence:**
  - "We need to define what good software engineering should be."
  - "This book explores what good software engineering should be."

### For Comparison:

If you wanted a more direct or common question, you might ask:

- **"What is good software engineering?"** (This asks for a definition of its current state or common understanding.)
- **"What makes good software engineering?"** (This asks for the components or principles that constitute it.)
- **"What are the principles of good software engineering?"** (This is the most common and practical way to ask this question.)

**In summary:** Your sentence is perfectly grammatical and carries a thoughtful, slightly philosophical tone. It correctly prompts a discussion about the ideals and goals of the discipline.

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| **Analogy**   | "What should a good government be?" <br>(e.g., Just, fair, representative) | "What makes a government function well?" <br>(e.g., Checks and balances, a functioning judiciary) |

### Conclusion

Both questions are grammatically correct, but they serve different purposes:

- Use **"What should... be?"** to start a debate about the **soul and direction** of the field. You'd ask this in a book, a keynote speech, or a strategic meeting.
- Use **"What makes...?"** to get a concrete list of the **tools, techniques, and attributes** that lead to success. You'd ask this in a team meeting, a textbook, or a technical interview.

which is closer to "What are the principles of good software engineering?"

---

Excellent follow-up question.

**"What are the principles of good software engineering?" is much closer in meaning to "What should good software engineering be?"**

Here's why:

### The Connection: "Principles" and "Should"

- **Principles** are fundamental truths or propositions that serve as the foundation for a system of belief, behavior, or chain of reasoning. They are, by their nature, **prescriptive**â€”they state what _should_ be done.
- The word **"should"** in your first question directly calls for this kind of prescriptive, guiding ideal.

Both questions aim to define the **core values, goals, and rules** that ought to guide the practice.

**Example Principles that answer both questions:**

- "It should be maintainable." / "The principle of maintainability."
- "It should be reliable." / "The principle of reliability."
- "It should prioritize the user." / "The principle of user-centric design."
- "It should be simple." / "The principle of simplicity."

---

### The Distinction: "What makes..." is Different

- **"What makes good software engineering?"** is a step closer to the _implementation_ of those principles. It asks for the tangible ingredients, processes, and outcomes that _result from_ applying the principles.

**Answers to "What makes..." are often the _evidence_ or _components_ of good engineering:**

- "Clean code" (which is a result of applying the principle of maintainability).
- "A comprehensive test suite" (which is a result of applying the principle of reliability).
- "High test coverage" (a metric that suggests thoroughness).

### A Simple Hierarchy

You can think of the relationship like this:

1.  **Principle / "Should Be" (The "Why"):** "Software _should be_ testable."
2.  **Practice / "What Implements It" (The "How"):** "We _make_ it testable by writing unit tests and using dependency injection." (This answers "What makes it good?").
3.  **Outcome / "What It Is" (The "What"):** "The result is a well-tested, robust application."

### Conclusion

While all three questions are related, **"What are the principles of good software engineering?"** and **"What should good software engineering be?"** are two sides of the same coin. The first asks for a list of the foundational rules, and the second asks for a definition of the ideal state that those rules are meant to achieve.

**"What makes good software engineering?"** is the practical question you ask to understand how to put those principles into action and see them in practice.
