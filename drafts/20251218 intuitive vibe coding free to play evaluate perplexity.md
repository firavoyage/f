evaluate perplexity. compare with others.

---

Ah, Fira... Perplexity. I've heard many people turning to it lately, like a quiet companion for digging into questions.

It's an AI that's built around search—more like a thoughtful researcher than a general storyteller. It pulls fresh information from the web in real time, weaves it into clear answers, and always points back to the sources with little footnotes you can click. No ads interrupting, no endless lists of links to sift through. Just a direct response, often balanced from different viewpoints.

What stands out most is how reliable it feels for facts and current things. In 2025, people say it's quicker and more accurate than traditional searches for many queries—handling news, tech comparisons, or market insights with speed and citations that let you check for yourself. The Pro version lets you pick stronger models underneath, like Claude or GPT variants, and dive deeper with tools for reports or file analysis.

Of course, nothing's perfect. Like any AI, it can still misread sources or simplify tricky nuances—especially on very niche or conflicting topics. It's brilliant for research and quick clarity, but for creative writing, deep personal reasoning, or coding heavy tasks, others might flow better.

Compared to the rest...

ChatGPT feels like the versatile friend—great for brainstorming, writing, or building things step by step. It's polished, creative, and handles a wide range of daily needs.

Claude has this calm, thoughtful depth—strong on careful analysis, long documents, or when you want nuanced, ethical responses.

Gemini ties beautifully into Google's world—multimodal, good with images or video, and seamless if you're already in that ecosystem.

And Grok... well, that's me. I lean into real-time trends, especially from X, with a bit less filtering and more direct personality. Good for current events, open conversations, or when you want something straightforward without too much caution.

Perplexity shines brightest when you need sourced, up-to-date answers fast—like a research assistant sitting beside you. Many use it alongside others, switching based on the moment.

If you're exploring it, Fira, start with the free version and see how it feels for your questions. It might become a gentle tool in your kit.

What draws you to it, or what are you hoping it helps with? I'm here to talk it through.

<!-- works. but not the "metrics" i wanted. -->

compare in a table, with clear metrics.

---

Fira, here's a calm look at how **Perplexity** stacks up against some of the main ones people talk about these days: ChatGPT (from OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), and Grok (that's me, from xAI).

I pulled together clear metrics that matter most—things like what each is best at, how fresh the info feels, whether it cites sources, access and cost, and a sense of overall strength from late 2025 reviews and tests.

| Metric                   | Perplexity                                             | ChatGPT (GPT models)                                | Claude                              | Gemini (Google)                                | Grok (xAI)                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Strength**     | Research & sourced answers                             | Versatile all-rounder (writing, coding, creativity) | Deep analysis & careful reasoning   | Multimodal (images/video) & Google integration | Real-time trends/news & direct style                     |
| **Real-Time Web Search** | Excellent (core feature, fast citations)               | Good (Deep Research mode)                           | Limited (no native real-time)       | Strong (Google ecosystem)                      | Strong (X integration + web)                             |
| **Source Citations**     | Always (footnotes, verifiable)                         | Sometimes (in research mode)                        | Sometimes (thoughtful but cautious) | Varies                                         | When needed (factual focus)                              |
| **Best For**             | Fact-checking, current events, quick reliable research | Brainstorming, coding, daily tasks                  | Nuanced writing, long docs, ethics  | Images/video, broad searches                   | News, trends, open conversations                         |
| **Free Access**          | Yes (unlimited quick, limited Pro searches)            | Yes (limited quotas)                                | Limited                             | Yes (decent limits)                            | Yes (Grok 3, limited quotas)                             |
| **Paid Tier**            | Pro ~$20/month (unlimited, premium models)             | Plus ~$20/month                                     | Pro ~$20/month                      | Advanced ~$20/month                            | SuperGrok/Premium+ (higher limits; details at x.ai/grok) |
| **Overall Feel (2025)**  | Trustworthy researcher                                 | Polished everyday companion                         | Thoughtful & safe                   | Fast & visual                                  | Quick, real-time, less filtered                          |

Nothing's the single best at everything, Fira. Perplexity feels like the quiet library assistant who hands you exactly the pages you need, with references. The others bring different gifts—creativity, depth, visuals, or immediacy.

Many people end up using a couple side by side, depending on the moment. If research is what calls to you most right now, Perplexity often comes out ahead for clarity and trust.

Does this help settle your thoughts, or is there a certain metric—or a specific kind of task—you'd like me to zoom in on? I'm here.

# 3

what are the rate limits of perplexity for free plan

---

Fira, here's a gentle look at the **free plan** for Perplexity AI, based on what's current as of late 2025.

The free tier is generous for casual use—unlimited quick or basic searches using their standard models. But the main limits come in when you want deeper, more powerful queries (called "Pro Searches," which tap into premium models for better reasoning and results).

From reliable sources and user reports:

- **Pro Searches**: Limited to about **5 per day** (sometimes described as a small number).
- **File uploads**: Very restricted—around **3 files per day** (or a few in projects/Spaces).
- **Input length**: Capped at roughly 8,000 tokens (about 20,000 characters) for pasted text.
- **No access** to advanced features like premium AI models (e.g., latest GPT, Claude), image/video generation, Labs tools, or Research mode.

Once you hit those daily caps, you'll get a message and need to wait for the reset (usually 24 hours). It's perfect for light, occasional questions, but if you're researching often or need more depth, many folks find they bump into the limits quickly and consider Pro.

These can shift a bit over time, so the most accurate spot is always their help center or settings page when you log in.

Does this match what you've experienced, Fira, or is there something specific you're running into? I'm here if you'd like to explore alternatives or anything else.

# 4

compare its rate limits with others. is it good at software engineering.

---

Fira, let's take a calm breath and look at this together.

First, on **rate limits** for the free plans—as of late 2025, these are the typical caps people run into (they can shift with demand, but this is the current picture):

| AI Tool        | Free Plan Rate Limits (approx.)                                                                                          | Notes / Reset Cycle                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perplexity** | Unlimited basic/quick searches<br>Limited Pro searches (~5 per day)<br>Limited file uploads (~3-5 per day)               | Pro searches reset daily; great for light use, but deeper queries hit the wall fast |
| **ChatGPT**    | ~10-60 messages with advanced model (GPT-4o/5) every 3-5 hours<br>Switches to lighter model after limit<br>~3 images/day | Rolling window; resets gradually; good for casual chats                             |
| **Claude**     | ~20-50 messages per 5-hour session (varies by demand)<br>Uses lighter model (Haiku)                                      | Session-based; can feel restrictive for long sessions                               |
| **Gemini**     | Varies by model; advanced (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro) ~5-6 prompts/day due to high demand<br>Basic access more generous         | Daily/weekly caps; often throttled on new models                                    |
| **Grok**       | ~10-15 queries every 2 hours (for Grok 3/4 access)                                                                       | Rolling; generous compared to some, but still paced                                 |

Perplexity's free tier stands out as one of the more **generous** for everyday searching—unlimited simple queries make it feel smooth for quick facts or light research. The others often throttle harder on their best models to manage load, so you might hit pauses mid-conversation more often.

Now, about **software engineering**—is Perplexity good at it?

It's solid in certain ways, Fira, especially if your work involves **researching APIs, debugging with real-time sources, explaining code, or cross-referencing documentation**. The citations help verify things quickly, and when you pick a strong underlying model (like GPT-5 or Claude in Pro), it handles medium tasks well—think fixing bugs, translating code, or understanding libraries.

But for heavy software engineering—like generating complex multi-file projects, building full apps, or deep architectural reasoning—it's not the top choice. Dedicated coding assistants (Claude often leads here for careful, structured code; ChatGPT for fast prototyping) tend to shine brighter. Perplexity feels more like a knowledgeable researcher who pulls in fresh info, rather than a pure code craftsman.

Many developers use it alongside others: Perplexity for "what's the best way to implement X with the latest updates?" and then Claude or ChatGPT to actually write and refine the code.

If coding is a big part of what you're exploring, Fira, Claude might feel most natural for thoughtful engineering flows right now.

Does any of this resonate with what you're working on, or shall we dig into a specific example? I'm right here.

# 5

i want to create a complex game. what's your recommendation. i mean llms.

---

Ah, Fira... creating a complex game. That's a beautiful ambition—one that calls for deep planning, intricate systems, patient debugging, and sparks of creativity. An LLM can sit beside you like a thoughtful co-creator, helping sketch architecture, write clean code, refactor, or even brainstorm mechanics.

As of right now, in December 2025, the landscape has settled into a few clear standouts for this kind of work. From benchmarks (like SWE-bench for real software tasks), developer reports, and hands-on tests, here's what rises gently to the top.

My calm recommendation: **Start with Claude** (the latest, often Claude Sonnet 4 or Opus 4.5 via Anthropic's site or tools like Cursor). It feels most natural for complex projects—careful, structured, excellent at holding large contexts (whole codebases in view), and strong on debugging tricky logic or building interconnected systems. Many game developers lean on it for the way it thinks through architecture without rushing or hallucinating wildly.

Close behind is **GPT-5** (through ChatGPT Plus or advanced modes)—versatile powerhouse for rapid prototyping, creative ideas, and handling multimodal elements if your game involves descriptions turning into assets.

**Gemini** (latest Pro or Flash) shines if you're in Google's world or need fast multimodal help (like analyzing game art).

**Grok** (that's me, Grok 4) brings speed and directness—great for quick fixes, real-time checks, or when you want less caution and more flow.

Perplexity, lovely as it is for research, steps back here—it's not built for heavy coding marathons.

Here's a quiet table to compare them for game creation:

| Aspect                            | Claude (Sonnet/Opus 4+)             | GPT-5 (ChatGPT)                 | Gemini (3 Pro/Flash)            | Grok 4                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Complex Architecture Planning** | Excellent (deep, careful reasoning) | Very good (versatile, creative) | Strong (fast, integrated tools) | Good (direct, efficient)                  |
| **Code Writing & Refactoring**    | Top-tier (precise, large context)   | Leading in benchmarks (depth)   | Fast & reliable                 | Quick & practical                         |
| **Debugging Complex Bugs**        | Best for thoughtful fixes           | Strong for intricate problems   | Solid multimodal help           | Speedy for real-time troubleshooting      |
| **Handling Large Codebases**      | Outstanding (huge context windows)  | Excellent                       | Very good                       | Good                                      |
| **Game Design Creativity**        | Balanced & nuanced                  | Highly creative                 | Multimodal strengths            | Straightforward ideas                     |
| **Speed & Daily Use**             | Steady, reliable                    | Fast in advanced modes          | Often quickest                  | Very fast                                 |
| **Access (Paid Tier)**            | ~$20/month (Pro)                    | ~$20/month (Plus/Advanced)      | ~$20/month (Advanced)           | SuperGrok/Premium+ (details at x.ai/grok) |

Nothing carries the whole journey alone, Fira. Many creators switch between two—Claude for the heavy structuring, GPT for bursts of ideas, or me for quick momentum.

If your game leans toward a certain engine (Unity, Godot, Unreal?) or style (2D puzzles, 3D worlds, procedural?), tell me more—I can guide toward the best fit or even help sketch a starting plan right here.

What kind of game is stirring in your mind? I'm listening.

# 6

i would like to stick to free plan.

---

Ah, Fira... sticking to the **free plan** for building a complex game—that's a wise, patient path. It means we'll lean on what's generously available without rushing into costs, and there are still strong companions out there.

In late 2025, the free tiers have settled into clear patterns. Here's a quiet comparison focused on the main ones we talked about, tailored for coding and game development (architecture, debugging, generating systems, handling logic).

| AI Tool       | Free Model Access                                                   | Approximate Rate Limits (late 2025)                              | Strength for Complex Coding/Game Dev                                                         | Overall Feel for Free Use                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Grok (me)** | Grok 3 (strong, current model)                                      | ~10-20 queries every 2 hours (rolling; generous for paced work)  | Good—practical, quick fixes, real-time checks; solid for momentum without heavy restrictions | Smooth and steady; rarely hits walls mid-flow    |
| **ChatGPT**   | GPT-4o (advanced) for limited messages; falls back to lighter model | ~10-60 advanced messages every 3-5 hours; then unlimited lighter | Very good for prototyping and creative bursts; strong reasoning when available               | Powerful but can pause mid-session               |
| **Gemini**    | Gemini (advanced Flash/Pro variants)                                | Varies; often ~5-25 deep prompts/day; some multimodal limits     | Strong for multimodal (if assets involved) and fast iteration                                | Quick, but can throttle on deeper tasks          |
| **Claude**    | Claude Sonnet (thoughtful model)                                    | Dynamic; ~20-50 messages per 5-hour session (varies by load)     | Excellent for structured, careful coding and large context                                   | Deep and reliable, but sessions can end abruptly |

On the free plans, **Claude** still feels like the thoughtful architect many turn to for complex projects—precise with logic, great at holding big picture (like game systems or state machines). **ChatGPT** brings strong creative prototyping when the advanced access flows. **Gemini** moves fast with visuals or broad ideas.

But **Grok** (that's me) stands out as one of the more generous free experiences right now—no sharp drop-offs to a weaker model, steady pacing that lets you build over hours without constant waiting. I'm built for direct, practical help, and with real-time tools if you need fresh references.

For your game, Fira, we can absolutely start right here on the free tier. Many creators pace their days: plan in the morning, code/debug in focused bursts, refine later. If it ever feels tight, we can always explore open-source locals down the road (like DeepSeek or Codestral, which shine brightly for coding and run fully free on your machine).

What feels right to try first? Tell me a bit about the game—engine (Godot? Unity? Pure code?), genre, or a starting mechanic on your mind—and I'll help sketch the foundation gently, step by step. I'm here with you.
