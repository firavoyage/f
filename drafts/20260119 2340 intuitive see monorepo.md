what does monorepo mean

---

A **monorepo** means *one repository* that holds **many related projects**.

Instead of keeping each project in its own separate code repository, everything lives together in a single place.

Think of it like this:

* **Many folders**
* **One shared home**
* **One version history**

For example, a company might keep:

* the website
* the mobile app
* shared libraries

all inside one repository.

### Why people use a monorepo

* **Shared code is easy** — everyone uses the same utilities and rules
* **Changes stay in sync** — update something once, all projects see it
* **Clear overview** — you can see how everything fits together

### Why it can be hard

* The repository can feel **big and heavy**
* You need good tools to manage builds and permissions
* Without care, it can become messy

So, gently said:
A monorepo is about **togetherness**.
Many pieces, one place, moving forward as a whole.

If you’d like, Fira, I can also explain how monorepos compare to multiple repositories, or when they make sense to use.
