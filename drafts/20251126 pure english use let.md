how to use "let" in english

---

Of course! The word "**let**" is a very common and useful verb in English, but it has a few different meanings and uses. Here’s a complete guide on how to use it.

### 1. To Give Permission (The Most Common Use)

This is used when you allow someone to do something.

**Structure:**
`Let + Person/Thing + Base Verb (infinitive without "to")`

- **"Please let me help you."** (You are giving them permission to be helped by you).
- **"My parents won't let me go to the party."** (My parents will not give me permission to go).
- **"She let her dog sleep on the bed."** (She allowed her dog to sleep on the bed).

**Important:** Notice that we **never** use "to" after `let`.

- ✅ Correct: "Let him try."
- ❌ Incorrect: "Let him to try."

---

### 2. To Make a Suggestion (Using "Let's")

This is a very common and friendly way to suggest doing something together. `Let's` is the contracted form of `Let us`.

**Structure:**
`Let's + Base Verb`

- **"Let's go to the movies tonight."**
- **"It's a beautiful day. Let's have a picnic."**
- **"Let's not argue about this."** (This is how you make a negative suggestion).

The negative form can be `Let's not...` or the more informal `Don't let's...` (more common in British English).

---

### 3. In the Imperative (Commands & Offers)

"Let" is often used to form polite commands, offers, or requests.

- **As a Command/Instruction:**

  - **"Let him in, please."** (A command to allow him to enter).
  - **"Let the cake cool for an hour before eating it."**

- **As an Offer:**
  - **"Let me carry that bag for you."** (I am offering to carry the bag).
  - **"Let us handle the details."** (We are offering to handle the details).

---

### 4. To Express an Assumption or "Supposing That..."

This is a more formal or literary use, often found in mathematics or logical arguments.

**Structure:**
`Let + `_`object`_`+`_`be`_`+`_`complement`_

- **"Let ABC be a right-angled triangle."** (Common in math).
- **"Let's say you won the lottery. What would you do first?"** (This means "Suppose you won the lottery...").

---

### 5. In Fixed Expressions & Phrasal Verbs

"Let" is part of many common phrases and phrasal verbs.

- **let go (of):** To release your grip or to stop worrying about something.

  - "**Let go** of the rope!"
  - "You need to **let go** of the past."

- **let someone know:** To inform someone.

  - "**Let me know** if you need any help."

- **let someone down:** To disappoint someone.

  - "I promised I would be there, and I don't want to **let her down**."

### Grammar Summary & Key Points

1.  **No "to" Infinitive:** After `let`, the verb is always in its base form (e.g., go, see, eat).
2.  **Past Tense:** The past tense of "let" is **`let`**. It is an irregular verb (let - let - let).
    - "She **let** me borrow her book yesterday."
3.  **Passive Voice:** It is unusual to use "let" in the passive voice. We usually use **`be allowed to`**.
    - ✅ Active: "They **let** him leave."
    - ✅ Passive: "He **was allowed to** leave."
    - ❌ Unnatural Passive: "He was let leave."

# 2

how would it change based on the subject

---

Excellent question! This gets to the heart of how "let" is unique. The short answer is: **The verb "let" itself does not change form based on the subject.**

Let's break it down.

### The Key Rule: "Let" is Invariable

Unlike most verbs in English, "let" keeps the same form for all subjects (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) in both the present and past tense.

| Subject       | Present Tense | Past Tense |
| :------------ | :------------ | :--------- |
| I             | **let**       | let        |
| You           | **let**       | let        |
| He / She / It | **let**       | let        |
| We            | **let**       | let        |
| They          | **let**       | let        |

**Examples:**

- "I **let** my friend borrow my car."
- "She **let** her friend borrow her car."
- "We **let** them enter the room."
- "Yesterday, he **let** me win the game." (Past tense, still "let")

---

### How the Sentence _Actually_ Changes

While the word "let" doesn't change, the rest of the sentence structure adapts to the subject and the meaning. The change happens in the **pronoun/object** that comes after "let" and the **context**.

#### 1. With Permission & Suggestions

The main change based on the subject is about **who is giving permission** and **who is being addressed**.

- **I (as the subject) give permission:**

  - "**I** will **let you** leave early." (I am the one allowing it).

- **He/She/It (as the subject) gives permission:**

  - "**She** doesn't **let her children** eat candy." (She is the one forbidding it).
  - "The app **lets you** track your orders." (The app gives you the ability).

- **We (as the subject) making a suggestion ("Let's"):**
  - "**Let's** go." (This is a fixed phrase. The subject "we" is implied in the contraction).

#### 2. In the Imperative (Commands & Offers)

In commands, the subject is the implied **"you"**.

- "(You) **Let him** speak!" (You are being told to allow him to speak).
- "(You) **Let me** see that." (You are being told to allow me to see it).

---

### Contrast with a Regular Verb

To see how unique "let" is, compare it with a regular verb like "to allow" (which has a similar meaning but follows normal grammar rules).

| Subject       | "to allow" (Follows Rules) | "to let" (Does NOT Change) |
| :------------ | :------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| I             | I **allow**                | I **let**                  |
| You           | You **allow**              | You **let**                |
| He / She / It | He **allows**              | He **let**                 |
| We            | We **allow**               | We **let**                 |
| They          | They **allow**             | They **let**               |

**Example Sentences:**

- "She **allows** her dog on the sofa." (Adds an 's' for third person singular)
- "She **let** her dog on the sofa." (No 's' added)

**Important Note:** "Allow" requires the preposition "to":

- ✅ "She **allows** her dog **to** be on the sofa."
- ✅ "She **lets** her dog be on the sofa." (No "to")

---

### The One Confusing Exception: "Lets" vs. "Let's"

This is the most common mistake, but it's not about the subject changing the verb. It's about two different words:

- **Lets** (without an apostrophe): The third-person singular form of the verb "to let," meaning he/she/it gives permission.

  - "If he **lets** me, I will go to the concert." (He gives permission).
  - "This software **lets** you edit videos easily." (The software gives the ability).

- **Let's** (with an apostrophe): The contraction of "**let us**," used for making a suggestion.
  - "**Let's** go to the concert." (I suggest that we go).

### Summary

- **The word "let" itself never changes spelling** based on the subject (I, you, he, we, they).
- The meaning changes based on **who the subject is** and the **object pronoun** that follows (let _me_, let _him_, let _them_).
- The only time you use "**lets**" is for he/she/it giving permission.
- "**Let's**" is a separate word for making suggestions.

So, while the subject is crucial for the sentence's meaning, it has very little power over the stubborn and invariable verb "**let**."

what are other invariable verbs

---

Excellent follow-up question! Invariable verbs are a fascinating part of English grammar. These are verbs that do not change form for different subjects (I, you, he, we, they) or in different tenses.

The most important categories of invariable verbs are **Modal Verbs** and a few other special cases.

---

### 1. Modal Verbs (The Main Group of Invariables)

Modal verbs express necessity, possibility, permission, or ability. They are **always** invariable.

The core modals are:

- **can**
- **could**
- **may**
- **might**
- **shall**
- **should**
- **will**
- **would**
- **must**

**How they are invariable:**

- **No -s for he/she/it:**
  - ✅ He **can** swim. | ❌ He **cans** swim.
  - ✅ She **must** go. | ❌ She **musts** go.
- **They are followed directly by the base form of another verb (without "to"):**
  - ✅ They **should leave**. | ❌ They **should to leave**.

**Examples:**

- I **can**, you **can**, he **can**, we **can**, they **can**.
- I **must**, you **must**, she **must**, we **must**, they **must**.

---

### 2. The Verb "Ought to"

While "ought" is a modal in meaning, it is unique because it is followed by **"to" + base verb**. It is still invariable.

- I **ought to** help.
- He **ought to** help. (Not "oughts")
- We **ought to** help.

---

### 3. The Subjunctive "Be" (in certain structures)

In formal English, the verb "be" remains as **"be"** for all subjects in certain commands, suggestions, and demands (this is called the mandative subjunctive).

- "I insist that he **be** here on time." (Not "that he _is_")
- "It's essential that she **be** informed." (Not "that she _is_")
- "The rule is that every member **be** present." (Not "that every member _is_")

---

### 4. Defective Verbs (Missing Forms)

These verbs are invariable because they are "defective"—they are missing certain forms (like a past tense, or an infinitive).

- **Beware:** This is almost always used in the imperative (command) form.
  - "**Beware** of the dog." (You can't say "I bewared" or "I will beware" is very rare and formal).
- **Quoth:** An archaic word for "said," used only in the past tense and with reversed word order. It's invariable because it's frozen in time.
  - "**Quoth** the raven, 'Nevermore.'" (It doesn't change, and you'd never use it in modern speech).

---

### Summary Table of Invariable Verbs

| Verb Type           | Examples                                                 | Key Feature                                                             |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modal Verbs**     | can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must | No -s in 3rd person; followed by base verb                              |
| **Ought to**        | ought to                                                 | Always "ought to"; no -s in 3rd person                                  |
| **Subjunctive**     | be                                                       | Used in "that..." clauses for demands/suggestions                       |
| **Defective Verbs** | beware, quoth                                            | Missing standard verb forms (past, participle, etc.)                    |
| **Main Verb**       | **let**                                                  | (From your previous question) Doesn't change for subject or past tense. |

### Important Note: What Looks Invariable But Isn't

Some verbs look the same for many subjects, but they _do_ have a different form for the third person singular in the present tense. "Let" is special because it doesn't change **even for the past tense**.

- **Example: "Put"**
  - I _put_, you _put_, we _put_, they _put_. (Looks invariable!)
  - But: He/She/It **puts**. (Ah, it changes!)
  - And it has a past tense: I **put** (yesterday). (Here it is the same, but it's not always invariable like a modal).

In contrast, a true invariable verb like **"must"** never changes: I must, you must, he must, we must, they must. There is no "musts" and no past form "musted".

So, while "let" is a standout example, its main company in being completely invariable are the **modal verbs**.

# 4

despite the modal verbs, what are all the invariable verbs, except the ones dont look like a verb

---

This is a great, nuanced question. You're asking for verbs that are truly invariable in modern English, excluding the obvious modal verbs, and focusing on those that clearly function as main verbs.

The list is actually very short. Beyond the modals, most verbs that are invariable are either **archaic**, **highly restricted in use**, or **so rare they barely qualify**. Here are the main ones that fit your criteria:

---

### 1. The Main Verb: **Let**

As we've already covered in detail, this is the primary example.

- **Present:** I let, you let, he/she/it **let**, we let, they let.
- **Past Tense:** I let, you let, he/she/it let, we let, they let.
- **Example:** "She **let** the cat out yesterday." (Not "lets" in the past, and not "letted").

---

### 2. Defective & Imperative-Only Verbs

These verbs are invariable because they are "missing" most of their conjugations. They primarily exist in the base form.

#### **Beware**

- **Use:** Almost exclusively used in commands, warnings, or infinitives. It feels formal or literary.
- **Why it's invariable:** You cannot say "he bewares" or "I bewared." It lacks standard tense forms.
- **Examples:**
  - "**Beware** of the dog!" (Command)
  - "They must **beware** the ides of March." (Infinitive after "must")
  - ❌ **Not Used:** "He bewares of danger." (Incorrect; we would say "He is wary of danger.")

#### **Mind** (in the imperative expression "Mind you")

- **Use:** This is a fixed phrase used to add a point, similar to "however" or "note well."
- **Why it's invariable:** It is frozen in this specific imperative form. We don't say "He minds you" with this meaning.
- **Example:**
  - "He's not very friendly. **Mind you**, he did help me once." (Here, "Mind you" is invariable).

---

### 3. The Marginal Modal: **Ought to**

While it has a "to," it behaves like a modal in being invariable.

- **Present:** I **ought to**, you **ought to**, he/she/it **ought to**, we **ought to**, they **ought to**.
- **Example:** "She **ought to** know better." (Not "oughts to").

---

### 4. Archaic / Fossilized Verbs

These are verbs that are no longer in common use and are only seen in their invariable, original form.

#### **Quoth** (meaning "said")

- **Use:** Archaic and poetic. It is only used in the past tense and with reversed word order (Verb-Subject).
- **Why it's invariable:** It is completely frozen in this form.
- **Example:** **"Quoth** the Raven, 'Nevermore.'" (It's always "quoth," never "quithe" or "quoths").

---

### Summary & Reality Check

To be perfectly clear, if we strictly exclude modals and verbs that "don't look like verbs," the practical, everyday list of truly invariable verbs is essentially:

1.  **Let** (the most common and important one)
2.  **Beware** (in very specific, limited contexts)

The others are either fixed phrases ("mind you") or historical artifacts ("quoth").

### Why This List is So Short

English grammar strongly favors a system where verbs change to agree with their subject (I _walk_, he _walks_) and to indicate time (I _walked_). The modal verbs (can, must, etc.) are a major exception because they come from a different historical class of verbs. **Let** is a rare survivor of a similar old pattern that didn't evolve to have distinct forms.

So, for all practical purposes, when you learn a new English verb, you should assume it is **variable** (I play, he plays, I played). Treat **let**, the modals, and **beware** as the special exceptions to the rule.
