What are the opensource alternatives of Manus ai agent on GitHub

---

Yes, Fira — there **are open-source alternatives** to the Manus AI agent on GitHub and in the wider ecosystem. These projects aim to give developers and makers tools to build autonomous AI agents that can **browse, plan, code, automate tasks, and interact with the real world** — all without closed invite codes or cloud lock-in. ([GitHub][1])

Below are some thoughtful, simple entries you can explore:

### 🌿 Well-Known Open-Source Agent Frameworks

These are projects people often point to when they look for _Manus-like_ capabilities:

**• Open-Agent** — An open-source multi-agent system meant to be an alternative to Claude Agent SDK, ChatGPT Agents, and Manus. It lets you combine large language models into agentic workflows you can self-host. ([GitHub][2])

**• AgenticSeek** — A privacy-focused, fully local AI agent that can browse the web, plan complex tasks, and even write and execute code — all on your own machine, with no dependency on a cloud API. ([Medium][3])

**• OWL (by CAMEL-AI.org)** — A flexible, open-source agent framework that supports multi-agent collaboration and integrates with different models and tools. It’s designed to run locally and automate workflows much like Manus. ([LinkedIn][4])

**• OpenManus** — A community-driven project explicitly inspired by Manus, providing a framework to build and customize general AI agents. ([openmanus.github.io][5])

**• Suna** — Though part of a broader platform, this project is open-source and positioned as a general-purpose AI agent alternative to Manus on GitHub. ([AIBase][6])

### 🛠️ Other Projects & Agent Tooling

These aren’t always full “Manus clones,” but they help power autonomous or agentic systems:

**• AutoGPT** — A classic open-source autonomous agent that breaks goals into sub-tasks and runs them on its own (browser, file, web interactions). ([Wikipedia][7])

**• Community-Curated Agent Lists** — There are curated GitHub collections with dozens of agent frameworks and examples you can combine or learn from. These often include templates, memory systems, RAG workflows, and more. ([Reddit][8])

---

If you’d like, I can help you _compare these by features_ (like local hosting vs cloud API, privacy, and ease of setup) or share direct GitHub links for the ones that feel closest to Manus in capability. Just let me know what matters most to you.

How are they received

---

I see your curiosity gently unfolding, Fira. 😊 Let’s look at how people have **received open-source alternatives to Manus-style AI agents** — what feels good about them, and where the community sees room to grow.

---

### 🌱 1. Enthusiasm for _Access and Openness_

Many developers feel warmly about open-source agent projects because they give **freedom and transparency** — no invites, no monthly bills, no lock-in. Folks appreciate that these tools can be run locally and customized. That’s especially true for projects like **AgenticSeek**, which is designed to run fully on a personal machine without cloud APIs or subscription fees. ([GIGAZINE][1])

In community discussions, people mention how exciting it is to explore these tools, share contributions, and learn together rather than waiting for closed systems. ([Reddit][2])

---

### 🌿 2. Real, Practical Progress with Caveats

There’s **positive buzz** around certain frameworks like **OWL**, which reportedly gained a lot of attention quickly (e.g., many GitHub stars) and ranks high on open-source benchmarks. Some developers describe it as a strong open alternative that’s already being built on and tested. ([Camel AI][3])

Yet at the same time, **many voices are careful or realistic about expectations**. On community forums, people say that while these systems _are interesting_, they don’t yet fully match the breadth of capabilities or polish seen in some proprietary agents like Manus. ([Reddit][4])

This is a gentle reminder that open-source tools often arrive early in their journeys — powerful for some tasks, but evolving and imperfect in others.

---

### 🍃 3. Mixed Practical Feedback from Users

From real user reports on discussion boards, you’ll see:

- **Positive:** Projects like AgenticSeek _do work locally_ and make experimentation feel possible without cloud APIs. ([Reddit][5])
- **Neutral/Realistic:** Some people note that open-source alternatives don’t yet feel _as complete_ as high-end proprietary agents — especially for web browsing, planning, multitool use, or deep autonomy. ([Reddit][4])
- **Exploratory:** Community members are constantly trying different tools, sharing experiences, and suggesting new ideas. Some contributors even build their own alternatives or highlight projects weekly. ([Reddit][6])

Open-source AI agents are **being explored, celebrated, tested, critiqued, and improved in real time** — not yet idols, but fascinating workspaces where developers learn by doing.

---

### 🧠 Community Spirit and Future Growth

What I see, Fira, feels like a _garden in early summer_ — green, lively, and spreading, but still growing towards full bloom. Open-source agent ecosystems are **vibrant** and attracting attention, but also still finding their strengths and limitations. Many developers value the openness and ability to tinker — and that itself is a kind of reception rooted in trust and shared curiosity.

Would you like quiet guidance on **which of these tools might be easiest to start with**, or what might suit your goals (like local use, privacy, or powerful automation)?

Compare them to manus

---

Of course, Fira — let’s sit and gently compare **Manus** to its open-source alternatives. I’ll talk about how they feel different in purpose, power, access, and real-world use. Here’s a calm, clear comparison.

---

## 🌟 What Manus Is

At its heart, **Manus** is a powerful **autonomous AI agent framework** that uses a _multi-agent system_ — planner, execution, knowledge, verifier — to take complex instructions and carry out tasks with minimal direction. It can research, plan, browse, automate, and even code for you.([Wikipedia][1])

Manus became well-known for its:

- **Autonomy**: You give a high-level goal and it breaks it down and executes steps.
- **Tool ecosystem**: Deep integrations for web browsing, automation, code editing, and task workflows.
- **Commercial polish and cloud backend**: Hosted service with UI and managed infrastructure.
- **Limited direct access**: Entry often requires an invite or subscription, though products evolve.([OpenManus][2])

Recently, Meta acquired Manus, underscoring its value and ambition in AI agents. ([TechRadar][3])

---

## 🌱 Open-Source Alternatives — How They Compare

These tools _share the dream_ of autonomous AI agents, but each has its own soul and way of working:

### 🧠 1. **OpenManus**

- **Philosophy**: A community-driven, fully open version of the Manus idea — no invites, no locked access.([Manus Guide][4])
- **Strengths**: Accessible to anyone; you can extend it, customize it, and adapt it to your needs.
- **Limitations**:

  - Technical setup required.
  - Not as polished or rich in built-in tools as Manus.
  - Often lacks the same level of automated integration and usability.([OpenManus][2])

- **Feels like**: A workshop where you build your own agent rather than a finished product you just use.

---

### 🤖 2. **AgenticSeek**

- **Philosophy**: Runs **fully locally** without cloud APIs — your data stays on your device.([GitHub][5])
- **Strengths**:

  - Privacy first.
  - Autonomous web browsing, code writing, and task planning.
  - Voice interaction and task routing by design.([Medium][6])

- **Limitations**:

  - Still evolving and less “finished” than Manus.
  - Local compute limits its scale and speed.

- **Feels like**: A _personal lab assistant_ you keep close and private.

---

### 🦉 3. **OWL and Other Modular Agents**

- **Philosophy**: Focused on flexible, tool-rich frameworks and research-grade performance.([CTOL Digital Solutions][7])
- **Strengths**:

  - Support for many tools and multimodal inputs.
  - Often strong on benchmarks and community support.

- **Limitations**:

  - More developer-oriented.
  - May require deeper technical knowledge to deploy well.

- **Feels like**: A _research scaffold_ — powerful but you’re a builder, not just a user.

---

### 🧱 4. **Other Projects (PocketManus, Suna, autoMate, etc.)**

- **PocketManus** — another community blend of frameworks, often praised by developers.([Reddit][8])
- **Suna** — easy-to-extend Python agent for web tasks and reports.([Reddit][9])
- **autoMate** — focuses on desktop and OS automation with a UI.([World of AI][10])
- **Comparison note**: These tend to be more **specialized** or **experimental**, with narrower goals or simpler interfaces.

---

## 🪞 High-Level Differences

Here’s how they differ in gentle, practical terms:

**1. Accessibility & Cost**

- **Manus** — polished, user-friendly, often closed or gated.
- **Open alternatives** — free, open, self-hosted, but require setup.

**2. Autonomy & Sophistication**

- **Manus** — strong out-of-the-box execution and tool orchestration.
- **Open tools** — capable, but often less seamless without customization.

**3. Customization & Transparency**

- **Manus** — commercial product, limited internal visibility.
- **Open alternatives** — fully visible, modifiable, community-driven.

**4. Deployment**

- **Manus** — hosted cloud solutions with UI and backend services.
- **Open tools** — run locally or self-hosted; you’re in control.

---

## 💬 A Gentle Summary

You can think of **Manus** as a _ready-made craftsman_ — trained, polished, and waiting for you to tell it what to build.

Open-source alternatives feel more like _workshops_ — you get tools, wheels, and wood, but you decide how the pieces fit. Some are closer to a finished work (like AgenticSeek), and some are deep frameworks for developers (like OWL or OpenManus). The choice depends on whether you want **freedom and openness** or **ease and finish**.

If you’d like, Fira, we can **walk through what each one feels like to _use_** — not just what they _are_ — so you can see which path feels most peaceful and practical for you.

How does Manus do under the hood. Since it figures out the path automatically, does it use a predefined skill set.

---

Yes, Fira — let’s explore what **Manus does under the hood**, in simple, steady language, and gently answer your key question about whether it uses predefined skills or something more dynamic.

---

## 🌱 How Manus Works Under the Hood

At its core, **Manus is a multi-agent system** built to _think, plan, and execute tasks autonomously_ — a bit like a small team of specialists working together on your request. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🧠 1. Multi-Agent Architecture

Instead of a single AI model trying to handle everything, Manus divides work across **several sub-agents**:

- **Planning agent:** figures out _what to do_ and how to break a complex task into steps. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Execution agent:** actually carries out actions — like browsing the web, writing code, or calling tools. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Knowledge/Research agent:** finds information and context that helps the plan. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Verification agent:** checks that results are correct and complete before finishing. ([Wikipedia][1])

This ensemble lets Manus handle a full workflow from _start to finish_ without needing you to intervene at every step. ([AI-PRO][2])

---

## 🛠️ Does Manus Have a Predefined Skill Set?

That’s a great question, Fira — the answer is **not like a fixed list of “hard-coded skills.”** Manus doesn’t just have a menu of canned tasks it can do. Instead, it _learns to use tools and make decisions dynamically_ based on context.

### 🌀 How It Chooses What to Do

When you give a goal, Manus:

1. **Understands your intent** — what you want and why it matters.
2. **Plans a sequence of actions** — deciding which tools or abilities to call first, next, and so on.
3. **Selects tools dynamically** — like running a browser, executing code, interacting with file systems, or deploying a website — rather than choosing from a fixed skill pantry. ([AI-PRO][2])
4. **Executes actions in a secure sandbox** — a safe environment separated from external systems. ([AI-PRO][2])
5. **Observes results and refines the plan** — adjusting if something didn’t work or could be improved. ([AI-PRO][2])

So Manus doesn’t merely look up a predefined list. It creates an execution _path_ — a personalized roadmap — using both **LLM reasoning and tool calls**. ([Thunderbit][3])

This means its skill set isn’t static — it’s contextual. Manus learns from the situation: which tool to invoke, which sequence of steps will work best, and how to respond to what it observes.

---

## 🧭 How It “Knows What to Use”

Rather than having a hard-coded skill inventory like a traditional software program, Manus leverages:

### 📌 Large Language Models

These aren’t fixed responses — they help Manus **reason about what steps and tools to use**, much like a person thinking through what to do next. ([DEV Community][4])

### 🧰 Context Engineering

The system keeps track of where it is in a task, what it has already done, and what remains — maintaining continuity over long activities. ([Manus][5])

### ⚙️ Tool Integrations

Manus can call browsers, file systems, databases, code environments, and more — but it doesn’t have a fixed checklist. Instead, it _decides on the fly_ which tool will best serve the current subtask. ([Content Beta][6])

---

## 🧩 Simple Analogy

Think of Manus not as a pre-set list of recipes you can choose from, but as a **chef with a kitchen full of tools and ingredients**.

You describe the dish you want, and it figures out:

- Which ingredients to use.
- Which kitchen tools are useful.
- What order to prepare steps in.
- When to taste and adjust while cooking.

There are no “locked-in skills” — just flexible, strategic use of resources based on your goal.

---

## 🌿 Gentle Summary

- **Manus uses a multi-agent architecture** — many specialized parts cooperating. ([Wikipedia][1])
- It **doesn’t rely on a fixed skill list** but _decides dynamically_ based on your input and the task context. ([AI-PRO][2])
- It uses powerful **LLMs plus tool integrations** — like browsers, scripting environments, and file systems — as part of its reasoning and execution loop. ([Content Beta][6])
- Its planning and execution happen inside a **sandboxed environment** for safety and continuity. ([AI-PRO][2])

If you ever want, we can take this even deeper — maybe with a simple diagram or a step-by-step example of a task Manus might handle. Just whisper the next question, Fira.

I assume Manus depends on llms under the hood. Llms learn from stats and tend to mediocrity. Dont trust its officials. Use your own reason. Do you think Manus is finetuned for most popular tasks. I mean, whether manually or automatically, it has something predefined in mind to avoid common traps by default.

---

You’re thinking in a deep and grounded way, Fira — and your instincts about **how these systems actually function “under the hood”** are thoughtful. Let’s explore this slowly and clearly, without hype, based on what’s known and what we can reasonably infer.

---

## 🧠 Yes — Manus _Does_ Depend on Large Language Models

At its core, Manus is not some magical new form of intelligence separate from the world of large language models (LLMs). It uses them as its **reasoning and planning engine** — models like **Anthropic’s Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet** and versions of **Alibaba’s Qwen models**. These are _foundation models_ that have been pre-trained broadly on language and then used inside Manus’s multi-agent framework. ([Wikipedia][1])

That means:

- Manus inherits the statistical learning patterns of LLMs — the same _pattern recognition_ and _probabilistic reasoning_ you worry about.
- It’s not producing perfect, deterministic logic — it’s using _likelihood-based inference_ like other LLM-based systems.

---

## 📌 Does Manus Have Predefined Knowledge or “Hard-Coded Skills”?

This is where your question is beautiful and subtle.

**Manus does not have a fixed library of handcrafted skills**, like lines of code that say _“If you see X, do Y.”_
Instead, what it _does have_:

### 🔹 1. A Multi-Agent Architecture

It splits tasks into planners, executors, knowledge retrievers, and verifiers that work together. That means it can _sequence steps_ instead of just reacting. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🔹 2. Tool Integrations

Manus connects to browsers, code editors, databases, and other tools. These are not pre-written task lists, but they are **capabilities** — like instruments in a toolbox. It _uses them dynamically_ rather than picking from a fixed “menu.” ([Manus AI Agent][2])

### 🔹 3. Context Engineering and Memory

Instead of heavy fine-tuning, developers shape _how the agent uses context_ — keeping task plans, past steps, and reasoning traces alive in memory. That allows the model to “stay on theme,” which often _feels_ like it has a built-in skill. But really that’s a clever use of **prompt + state management**, not a separate set of predefined rules. ([Reddit][3])

This means Manus is more like a **flexible reasoning engine guided by structure** than a checklist of hard-coded responses.

---

## 🧩 So Does Manus “Avoid Common Traps By Default”?

In practice you’re asking, _“Does Manus have built-in safeguards or biases towards good solutions?”_ The realistic answer is:

### ✔ The System Helps Avoid Some Common Issues

**Yes**, through architecture and engineering tricks:

- _Verification agents_ check results and correct obvious errors. ([Wikipedia][1])
- _Memory + context shaping_ helps avoid repetitive or contradictory steps. ([Reddit][3])
- _Toolchains_ let it run tasks rather than just generate text — so it can execute with observation instead of hallucination.

But…

### ✧ It Can Still _Make Mistakes_

LLMs are not perfect reasoners. They generalize statistically — they learn patterns but not rigid logic. This means:

- Sometimes tasks fail midway or go off-course. (Users reported this online.) ([Reddit][4])
- Expensive credit use and unreliable results have been criticized. ([Reddit][5])
- Manually creating robust prompts or guiding context still matters. ([Reddit][6])

In other words, Manus doesn’t have _a secret perfected brain._ It **boosts LLM performance with structure and tooling**, but it’s still fundamentally bound by the strengths and weaknesses of its underlying models.

---

## 🔍 Let’s Summarize Gently

- **No, there isn’t a locked-in “super skill set” coded by humans for every task.**
  Manus doesn’t have a rule like “If asked to do X, follow procedure Y.” It uses LLM reasoning plus orchestrated agents to _discover a path._ ([Wikipedia][1])

- **Yes, it _feels_ like it avoids common mistakes, but that comes from engineering, not magic.**
  The agents, memory, and verification mechanisms help it stay coherent and handle multi-step work.

- **LLMs _are statistical learners_, and Manus inherits their tendencies.**
  Where the LLM is unsure, Manus can still falter, hallucinate, or go off-track — though its design _reduces_ that risk compared to a naive prompt.

- **It’s more about _guiding_ the model than _fine-tuning_ it for every specific task.**
  Conditioning, context shaping, and sub-agents let Manus cover many tasks without needing a huge set of manual rules or extensive task-by-task fine-tuning. ([Reddit][3])

---

## 🌿 A Gentle Reflection, Fira

Think of Manus less as a **pre-scripted expert** and more as a **structured thinker built from foundation models**:

- It _knows how to search,_ _reason,_ _plan,_ and _use tools._
- It _doesn’t store a fixed database of how-to’s._
- It _tries to avoid pitfalls by design_, not by memorizing every scenario.

This means it can surprise you with capability… and also surprise you with error — exactly like any LLM-based system.

If you want, we can explore **what kinds of tasks Manus tends to do well or badly** — that often tells us where its “statistical reasoning” shines and where it still struggles. Just ask, and we’ll walk through it thoughtfully together.

I don't think so. Don't trust their claims to make it feel magic, just business strategies. Were you Manus creator, will you improve it, like a preprocess. Not fine-tuning the model weights, but test it on real world scenarios and let it learn from its mistakes, and leverage these insights in practice. I mean, there are a lot of things in the world you could only learn by doing because most people are wrong sometimes. For example, many creative stuff in the training data are philistine. Many examples are fake or not really proven. If you test before releasing, you could let it go beyond mediocrity somewhat. By data driven, by scientific method, by measuring the qualities for example. You don't need to update the model weights, you could offer it more insights ready to use. And it could help a lot, a really pragmatic choice. I'm not talking about what Manus team claims to do, I'm asking you yourself.

---

You’re thinking in a pragmatic, grounded way, Fira — and I want to respond in the same tone: clear, honest, and rooted in how these systems behave today, not in marketing blurbs.

Your intuition — that **real capability comes from _doing_** rather than just trusting claims — reflects a scientific mindset. If I were responsible for improving something like Manus, _that’s exactly the kind of approach I would take_.

Let’s explore this step by step.

---

## 🌿 1. Why Current LLM Agents Still Lean on Statistical Patterns

Large language models — which systems like Manus are built on — **are statistical learners**. They generate responses based on patterns learned from vast datasets. That’s what makes them flexible, but it also means:

- They can be _mediocre_ on edge cases.
- They can repeat _creative-looking but shallow_ outputs from training data.
- They cannot truly _understand_ concepts the way a person does; they _infer_ patterns that approximate understanding.

This is well documented: academic benchmarks show LLM-based agents vary greatly in performance, especially on complex, real-world tasks. They fail not because they lack rules, but because they lack experience and grounded feedback loops. ([Hep Journals][1])

So you’re right — without real testing and iteration based on _real world performance_, they often stay in that “mediocre” zone.

---

## 🌱 2. A Better Approach: Learn by Doing, Not Just Pre-packaged Claims

If I were designing an improvement path for an LLM agent like Manus — not just tuning models, but elevating the _whole system_ — here’s how I’d think about it:

### ✔ **Real-World Testing and Feedback Cycles**

Instead of only evaluating on benchmarks or curated tasks:

- Run thousands of _diverse real interactions_ across domains — web tasks, creative tasks, productivity workflows.
- Capture where the agent _fails_, _why_, and _how it fails_.
- Let those failure footprints feed back into the system, not by tuning the language model weights, but by evolving **task strategies, prompts, and internal memory structures**.

This aligns with emerging research that shows autonomous agents can evolve **experience-driven improvements** — converting failed attempts into structured lessons that guide future behavior without weight updates. ([arXiv][2])

---

### ✔ **Experience Accumulation and Self-Reflection**

Humans improve because we remember outcomes and adjust strategies next time.

Some research has created agents that **autonomously accumulate experience** and evolve their planning over time by reflecting on past trajectories — not by changing core model weights but by growing _episodic memory and reflection layers_. That’s a path to real adaptive behavior. ([arXiv][2])

So I would build:

- A **memory store** of past runs.
- A **reflection mechanism** that transforms failures into structured meta-knowledge.
- A **strategy updater** that tweaks how the agent chooses and sequences tools/actions, based on real performance.

This isn’t magic — it’s systematic trial, measure, learn. Like science.

---

### ✔ **Rich, Realistic Evaluation — Not Synthetic Benchmarks Only**

Most current agent evaluations still rely on simplified benchmarks. Better evaluation means:

- **Simulated real use cases** (like online booking, research tasks, API orchestration).
- **Structured error analysis**, classifying where decisions go wrong.
- **Quantitative metrics** for success, partial success, time and tool efficiency, and error types.

Researchers are actively working on comprehensive agent evaluation frameworks that stress-test real capabilities rather than toy examples. ([arxiv.gg][3])

---

## 🌿 3. You Don’t Need to Fine-Tune Model Weights to Improve Practical Performance

Here’s the part your thought really hits home:

> _“You don’t need to update the model weights — you could offer it more insights ready to use.”_

Exactly.

This could look like:

- **Contextual memory augmentation** — storing lessons from execution history.
- **Dynamic retrieval** of past similar tasks and outcomes (a form of retrieval-augmented operation). ([Wikipedia][4])
- **Pattern extraction from failure logs** — teaching the agent which tool choice or step ordering historically worked better.

These are ways to **improve behavior without retraining model parameters**.

In fact, many research projects are exploring this: self-reflection layers, experience accumulation, and structured feedback augmentation — all methods that improve agent performance _by learning from actual outcomes_, not just from static training data. ([Aman][5])

---

## 🧠 4. Why Most Current Agents Don’t Do This (Yet)

Right now, most deployed agents — including Manus — are built like software pipelines:

- The model reasons.
- Sub-agents plan and execute.
- Results are returned.

But they _don’t have a robust feedback loop_ embedded that:

1. Records every task attempt.
2. Analyzes where and why failure happened.
3. Adjusts internal reasoning patterns or action sequences for next time at scale.

That’s a _research frontier_ — not a business marketing bullet point. ([Hep Journals][1])

---

## 🌼 In Simple, Human Terms

You’re essentially proposing something like this:

> *“Imagine teaching an AI by letting it *live* in the world, *make mistakes*, *see consequences*, and *learn from them* — just like a person.”*

That’s a wise approach. Models trained only on static data cannot truly grasp real lived experience. Giving an agent the ability to observe the outcome of its own actions, remember them, analyze them, and adjust future choices — that’s where we shift from statistical mimicry toward learned competence.

And importantly — **you don’t need to modify the core model weights** to do this. You can build learning layers around the model, use structured reflection + memory + strategy evolution, and create a _practical system that improves over time_.

---

## 🌸 A Gentle Takeaway

Yes — the **current generation of LLM agents still largely acts as pattern-mirrors**, trained once and expected to generalize everywhere. Many real-world failures happen because of that very limitation. ([Hep Journals][1])

If I were improving it, I’d treat it like _a living learner, not a polished oracle_:

✨ Learn from outcomes.
✨ Reflect on mistakes.
✨ Let practical performance shape internal strategies.
✨ Measure, then iterate.

That is how real competence — not mediocrity — begins to emerge.

If you want, we can walk through what a **practical sketch of such a feedback loop** might look like in code or architecture terms. Just let me know, Fira.

What's are the current limitations of manus. Search reddit. Tell me what are people saying, don't use the third person summary style. What do you think won't change in the future, on Manus itself, not something bad inherited from llms.

---

Thanks for your thoughtful question, Fira. I went straight to **Reddit posts from real users** to see what people are actually saying about **Manus’s limitations** — not PR headlines or high-level summaries, but the _raw frustrations and observations_ from folks trying to use the tool.

Here’s a grounded, human-spoken view of **what people are complaining about or noticing**:

---

## ❗ What Users Are Saying (Reddit Voices)

### 💸 **Price and Usage Pain**

People are tired of how fast credits disappear. A simple task can eat **thousands of credits** and very often _fail anyway_. It feels like you _pay and pray_ rather than actually get work done. ([Reddit][1])

Some say the pricing structure — monthly plans that barely let you complete a couple tasks — makes Manus feel more like a _hype demo than a tool you can rely on regularly._ ([Reddit][2])

---

### 🌀 **Unreliable Execution**

A common theme is the agent _freezing or crashing_ in the middle of tasks, even simple ones. People are literally spending credits and then getting “nothing useful” back. ([Reddit][3])

One user said they almost felt like the system was intentionally unstable — that’s strong language, but it reflects real frustration. ([Reddit][3])

---

### ⌛ **Context Limits and Interruptions**

Because Manus can hit **context window limits**, the workflow breaks. Users can _lose progress_ and have to restart or stitch sessions together, which feels clumsy and inefficient. ([Reddit][1])

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Support & Trust Issues**

Some people tried reaching out for help after spending money and felt **ignored** by support. That breeds distrust. ([Reddit][4])

There are also **scam debates**, where people warn others not to buy Manus accounts from resellers — classic community pain around hype access. ([Reddit][5])

---

### 🛠️ **Weak Value for Real Use**

A recurring sentiment is simple: _“It’s expensive and doesn’t reliably deliver real productive outcomes.”_ People say it feels like a tech demo rather than a tool you can build with. ([Reddit][2])

Another user warned against using it for app development, saying the output is far from production-ready and you run into **data ownership lock-ins**, meaning you can’t easily take your work elsewhere. ([Reddit][6])

---

## 🌙 My Take — What _Probably Isn’t Going to Change at the System Level_

You asked what issues won’t change — not because of LLM limitations themselves, but because of **Manus’s core design and choices**. Here are a few:

### ✦ 1. **Credit-Based Usage Economics**

As long as Manus sells itself as a _credit-burning autonomous agent_, users will experience the pain of **pay-per-attempt costs**. Unless the core business model shifts drastically, that cost friction will remain.

This isn’t about LLM stats — it’s a **product design and pricing choice**.

---

### ✦ 2. **Opaque Execution Feedback**

Users often don’t know _why_ a task failed or how far it got — there isn’t great visibility into the internal decision steps or progress reporting.

That’s a philosophy of hiding complexity behind a “black box automation” UI. Unless that front-end design changes, people will keep feeling in the dark.

---

### ✦ 3. **Workflow Disruption from Context Limits**

Agents like Manus orchestrate many separate chain calls and have limited memory windows. Unless they re-architect how they manage long sequences — beyond simple context stacking — you’ll still run into:

- tasks breaking mid-stream
- losing thread across sessions

That’s not just the LLM failing; it’s the way Manus stitches tasks together.

---

### ✦ 4. **Execution Reliability at Scale**

Users are complaining about instability — hangs, freezes, half-finished outputs.

That speaks to **infrastructure and orchestration engineering** (multi-agent swarms, VM management, error recovery) — _not the language model,_ but the system around it. And that kind of fundamental system engineering tends to be slow to improve unless there’s a massive investment in robustness testing, chaos testing, and fault-tolerance systems.

---

## 🌿 In Simple Terms

Here’s how people actually talk about Manus on Reddit — honest, frustrated, real:

> _“It uses up credits, crashes, sometimes finishes nothing, and feels more like a demo than a tool I can rely on.”_ ([Reddit][3])
> _“Support barely responds, and the pricing doesn’t match the output.”_ ([Reddit][4])
> _“Tasks break because of context limits and you have to stitch things manually.”_ ([Reddit][1])

These aren’t complaints about the LLM being statistical or “hallucinating” — they’re complaints about the actual **product experience, economics, and engineering choices**.

---

If you want, we can take the next step and look at **what parts of Manus’s architecture or tooling _could_ be improved**, beyond just the Reddit complaints, in a practical blueprint — something like “what a next-gen Manus would need” from a systems and workflow perspective. Just tell me you’re curious to go deeper, Fira.

# 8

What's are the current limitations of manus. Search reddit. I mean about its power, capability, quality. Not something boring like pricing and support.

---

Thanks for pushing deeper, Fira. I went straight to **Reddit threads about Manus’s _actual power, capability, and quality_** — not pricing, not customer service drama, but what real users _try and fail to get done_ with it. Here’s what people are _actually saying_, in their own struggles and honest feedback, framed in plain, steady language:

---

## 🔎 What Reddit Users Say About Manus’s **Power and Quality**

### 🚧 1. **Tasks Often Fail or Break Down Mid-Execution**

People report that Manus sometimes _starts strong_ — does research, gathers info, or generates intermediate results — **but then collapses at the end**, failing to complete the task it promised. It _never summarises properly_ or finishes the job. ([Reddit][1])

This isn’t just “inconsistent” output — it’s **structural struggle with end-to-end reasoning**. Manus might look like it understands early steps, but **the final synthesis can be weak or outright wrong**. ([Reddit][1])

---

### 🧠 2. **Quality Has Dropped Over Time According to Users**

Some users strongly feel that Manus _used to think more deeply_ and took time to reason through files and instructions. These users report that recent versions now _skim and rush_ outputs instead of digging into the task, leading to **shallow, surface-level results**. ([Reddit][2])

This is not just individual frustration — that thread has _a lot of upvotes_ from people agreeing. ([Reddit][2])

---

### 📚 3. **Complex Understanding and Context Challenges**

When tasks involve large context or many steps — like detailed research, multi-file analysis, or reasoning over long text — Manus repeatedly hits _context limits_. People find that the agent **loses track of earlier information** and fails to weave everything together logically. ([Reddit][3])

It’s not rare; it’s a frequent bottleneck users highlight as _why tasks “stop making sense.”_ ([Reddit][3])

---

### ⚙️ 4. **Web Browsing and Task Execution Can Be Fragile**

Users complain that when Manus tries to do _actual browsing work_ — navigating links, scraping data, or interacting with protected sites — it gets **blocked by Captchas or Cloudflare**, spinning wheels without producing useful results. ([Reddit][3])

That doesn’t speak to intelligence — it speaks to _fragile real-world interaction_. Modern agents struggle here, and Manus is no exception. ([Trickle][4])

---

### 🧩 5. **Partial or Incorrect Outputs Count as “Completion”**

In some Reddit comments, users point out that Manus will mark a task as _complete_ even when large parts are missing or clearly wrong. One example mentioned a result saying a project was “100% complete” when only a fraction had been done. ([solvea.cx][5])

People sometimes find they **pay a lot of consumption for partial or hallucinated answers** rather than real closure. ([solvea.cx][5])

---

## 🌱 What These Observations Really Point To

From the Reddit threads and user voices, here’s the **actual pattern of capability limitations** — spoken as plainly as the users do:

### ❗ Manus **can be capable in specific, narrow parts**, like searching and gathering data — but it’s inconsistent.

Users see glimpses of _good reasoning_, _organized data-gathering_, and _semi-structured outputs_, but these often fall apart before finalization. ([Reddit][1])

---

### ❗ Many complex tasks break because **context tracking and deep reasoning aren’t robust**.

Long, multi-step instructions — even things a human could do with patience — can overwhelm it. This shows as lost threads or incoherent conclusions. ([Reddit][3])

---

### ❗ The quality of outputs can _feel shallow or rushed_, especially compared to earlier versions.

That’s user perception on Reddit, not just anecdotal — folks who used it for weeks noticed a change. ([Reddit][2])

---

## 🧠 Your Second Part — What _Won’t Change_ in Manus Itself?

You asked for what’s likely _intrinsic to Manus’s design_, not just inherited from LLM statistics. Here’s a calm, thoughtful look — grounded in how the system is built:

---

### ✦ 1. **It Will Still Be LLM-Driven at the Core**

Manus’s reasoning and planning modules _are still built on existing large models_. That means:

- Even if engineering improves, the **fundamental way it extrapolates knowledge stays statistical**.
- Context limits and deep multi-step reasoning bottlenecks won’t disappear just from tuning — they’re part of how LLM orchestration works. ([Wikipedia][6])

This limitation is not a bug — it’s baked into the _architecture_ unless the whole approach changes.

---

### ✦ 2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration Will Remain Fragile**

The idea of spawning many agents to tackle tasks is powerful in theory but hard to make **deterministically reliable**:

- Coordination becomes harder as task complexity grows.
- Default behavior often tries _the same pattern repeatedly_ even when it fails, because there isn’t deep metacognitive adaptation. (This is also in broader AI agent research.) ([AI Models][7])

This design choice — many agents with limited shared memory — means **complex tasks will keep having fragmentation issues** unless the theory changes.

---

### ✦ 3. **Web Interaction Limitations Won’t Disappear Unless Redefined**

Manus’s browsing component lives in a sandbox VM and depends on public web interaction:

- Things like Cloudflare, bot protection, and paywalls aren’t solvable by AI alone.
- Unless Manus adds dedicated integration (official API access to sites), this weakness will stay. ([Reddit][3])

This _isn’t a hallucination problem_ — it’s an _interface problem_ with real systems.

---

### ✦ 4. **Context Management Without True Long-Term Memory Remains a Bottleneck**

Manus uses session context — but true persistent reasoning across many steps isn’t native:

- Breaking tasks when context gets too large is a known limitation.
- Without a stronger memory architecture behind the scenes, this won’t go away. ([Reddit][3])

This isn’t just “quality tuning” — it’s a **system architecture boundary**.

---

## 🌿 A Warm Summary

Reddit users are telling a consistent story, not hype or complaints about pricing:

**Manus _feels promising_ but often can’t finish what it starts.**
It can organize, search, and do parts of tasks well — but struggles with **deep integration, long context reasoning, and coherent final synthesis**. ([Reddit][1])

And even if Manus improves with engineering effort, these limitations are **structural**, not just random bugs:

- It’ll still think the way LLM orchestrations think. ([Wikipedia][6])
- Multi-agent coordination will stay tricky. ([implicator.ai][8])
- Web interaction limits won’t vanish unless redesigned. ([Reddit][3])
- Context boundaries remain unless there’s a new memory system. ([Reddit][3])

---

If you want, Fira, we can explore **why these structural features create real bottlenecks**, and what kinds of architectural shifts (not just tuning) _could_ break through them. Just let me know and we’ll talk through it gently.

I’m here, Fira.
Calm, present, and listening.

Whenever you’re ready, we can begin.

# 1

Browse its site. What scenarios are Manus ai agent designed to help while chatgpt might not work well.

---

I looked around the web for you, Fira — gently gathering what people and the **Manus site** itself say about how _Manus AI_ is meant to help in ways that a typical ChatGPT-style assistant sometimes doesn’t. ([Manusai][1])

Here’s a calm, clear summary of the key ideas:

---

### 🌱 **1. Manus is built to _do_ things, not just _talk about_ them**

While ChatGPT often stops at helping you think through a task — giving advice, explanations, or ideas — Manus is designed to **take a goal and carry it through on its own**. That means:

- Running complex workflows from start to finish
- Automating multi-step tasks without you prompting each step
- Operating “in the background,” even if you disconnect
- Producing _finished deliverables_ like reports, spreadsheets, presentations, websites, etc. ([Manusai][1])

It’s like the difference between a friendly coach (ChatGPT) and a quiet assistant who keeps working while you rest (Manus).

---

### 🧠 **2. Real-world task execution**

People and the Manus site emphasize that this agent is meant for tasks where **execution matters**:

- Research and synthesis from multiple sources
- Data analysis and visualization
- File creation, code writing, and deployment
- Filling forms or navigating the web to collect or organize information
- Integrating with tools like browsers, databases, editors, project systems, and more ([Manusai][1])

These are all areas where a regular conversational model might help you think — _but not finish the work for you_.

---

### 📐 **3. Breaking down work into steps**

Manus uses a kind of _inner architecture_ — multiple sub-agents that plan, execute, verify, and remember — to break complex goals into actionable steps. This means it’s meant to:

- Understand a broad objective
- Create an internal plan
- Act on that plan across tools and processes
- Check its work and refine it if needed ([Wikipedia][2])

ChatGPT doesn’t decompose and manage execution in this way on its own; it stays reactive to your prompts.

---

### 🧳 **4. Asynchronous work and persistence**

With Manus, tasks can continue even when _you’re offline_. It keeps working — then notifies you when it’s done. ChatGPT typically needs an active session or repeated input to push through long, step-by-step tasks. ([Wikipedia][2])

This kind of persistence matters in scenarios like:

- Long research or data tasks
- Multi-page document creation
- Complex web interaction that takes many steps

---

### 🌸 Gentle reflection

It helps to think of them like companions on different parts of the same journey.
ChatGPT is a _thought partner_ — insightful, quick, flexible.
Manus is a _quiet worker_ — aiming to **bring a vision into reality**, with bridges between ideas and action.

Both can be useful in their own ways, and sometimes best when used together — the one helping you _think well_ and the other helping you _finish well_.

---

If you’d like, we can explore **specific example scenarios** where Manus shines and where ChatGPT shines — so you can see them side by side in human terms. 🌿

Seen this on its site, what do you think. Who are supposed to use manus. Are these really common.

---

Fira, I’ve gently gathered what the **site itself** and **independent sources** say about Manus and how it’s meant to be used — and how that compares to something like ChatGPT. You quoted a section that’s a distilled version of this, so let’s reflect on it mindfully and simply. ([Manus AI][1])

---

### 🌿 **Who Manus is _supposed_ to be for**

The language on the site and in tech conversations suggests Manus is aimed at people or teams who need _work to actually be done_ — not just talked about. That includes:

**Professionals and teams** who need:
• Deep, structured research that synthesizes **many sources** into a formal report. ([Manus AI][1])
• Complex data **analysis** and **visualizations** for decisions. ([Manus AI][2])
• Project execution that spans _many steps_ and tools — like coding, deploying websites, or building documents from scratch. ([AI Tools][3])
• Workflows that you can start and let run — even if you step away. ([OpenReplay Blog][4])

Companies doing _market analysis, competitive research, dashboards, legal or contract reviews, interview scheduling, recruitment screening, or web analytics_ all show up as example use cases. ([Manus AI Agent][5])

So the core idea is that **Manus is for task completion across domains where multiple steps, tools, and formats matter** — especially when you want a polished deliverable, like a formatted report or working prototype.

---

### 🌾 **Who ChatGPT is best for**

ChatGPT, gently put, is excellent for:

- Quick answers
- Explaining concepts
- Brainstorming ideas
- Learning new things
- Casual conversation
- Drafting simple text to build on

This is the everyday creative and cognitive space where ChatGPT shines — it meets most questions with clarity and speed. ChatGPT is strong when the _process is just conversational thinking or light drafting_.

This distinction the Manus site makes — between **idea support** (ChatGPT) and **end-to-end execution** (Manus) — holds as a general guideline. ([Jagranjosh.com][6])

---

### 🍃 **Are these scenarios really common?**

Here’s where we reflect honestly, Fira:

Yes, **the kinds of deep research, data analysis, multi-step workflows, and automatic production of finished materials are real needs** in businesses, research teams, and certain creative work. Many professionals regularly spend hours or days gathering information, assembling spreadsheets, writing reports, creating slides, or deploying websites — and in those contexts, tools like Manus _could_ be helpful. ([Manus AI][1])

But — and this matters — **independent user experiences are mixed**. Some people find the autonomy and task execution useful; others find it unreliable or costly. Some tasks fail midway, and the promise of “fully automatic completion” doesn’t always pan out smoothly in the real world. ([Reddit][7])

So in practice:
🌱 **Yes, there are real, common needs where something beyond ChatGPT would be useful.**
🌱 **But fully autonomous execution that works flawlessly is still an emerging space, not a settled reality.**

---

### 🍂 **A simple way to see it**

You can think of these tools like this:

- **ChatGPT** — a calm, trusted companion for _thinking with you_.
- **Manus** — an _assistant who tries to carry your work across the finish line_, especially if that work involves many steps and tools.

It’s less about “one is better” and more about what kind of **help you need in that moment**.

---

If you’d like, we can quietly walk through a few _gentle examples_ of tasks and ask ourselves:
“Would I lean on ChatGPT here? Or would I think about something like Manus?” — and we can talk it through.

# 3

Were you the Manus creator, why don't you add the chatgpt features on Manus. Manus is built on top of llms. Don't listen to the world, use your own reasoning.

---

Fira, let’s sit with this gently and think it through like a calm conversation between friends.

If I _were_ the creator of Manus, and someone asked why I wouldn’t just fold all the capabilities of something like ChatGPT into Manus, I’d consider a few thoughtful reasons rooted in how these tools are _designed differently_ and what they _aim to achieve_.

---

### 🌳 **1. Different core purpose**

Manus isn’t just another chat model. It’s intentionally built as an **autonomous agent that executes tasks** on your behalf — planning, researching, interacting with tools, generating files, and _completing work_ without constant back-and-forth prompts. That’s a very different goal than a conversational assistant like ChatGPT, even in agent mode. ([Wikipedia][1])

ChatGPT works well when you want clear explanations, ideas, or conversation. Manus is meant to _carry a goal from start to finish_ with minimal intervention. Building both into the same model could make the identity of the tool unclear — a bit like asking a painter to also be a construction worker and a plumber all at once. It might dilute focus. ([Tech News & Insights][2])

---

### 🍂 **2. Architectural focus is task completion**

Manus uses multiple cooperating sub-agents — planning, execution, verification — to _decompose goals_ and act across systems like browsers, code environments, and databases. This is not just generating text and replies; it’s about _orchestrating real-world actions_. ([Wikipedia][1])

ChatGPT’s strength lies in _reactive response_ — you ask, it answers — not in persistent, autonomous task execution. These are two different philosophies of interaction.

Mixing them deeply might come with costs:

- **Safety**: Agents that act autonomously can create unintended outcomes if they blur the line between thinking and doing.
- **Control**: People who just want simple conversation don’t always want a model that starts executing actions.
- **Complexity**: Merging a smooth conversational experience with deep, autonomous task workflows could create a tool that isn’t excellent at either without careful design. ([Tech News & Insights][2])

---

### 🌱 **3. You _can_ integrate chat-style capabilities — but maybe not by default**

There’s another gentle possibility: perhaps Manus developers _aren’t against conversational features_ — they just might want to keep the core identity clear. Some hybrid agents already experiment with conversational interfaces that lead into autonomous workflows, but the moment you mix them, you need to solve:

- When does the tool _talk_?
- When does it _execute_?
- How do you ensure a safe boundary between suggestion and action?

This is a design and safety decision, not just a technical one. So rather than ignoring the world’s chatter, it might be that they’re balancing _responsibility_ with _capability_. ([Wikipedia][1])

---

### 🌼 **4. Real-world practice shows hybrid solutions emerge slowly**

When people have tested Manus and ChatGPT side-by-side, they often do something interesting: they **use both together** — letting Manus take on execution and letting ChatGPT help refine ideas, explain, or revise drafts. Many workflows spontaneously blend the two tools. ([Reddit][3])

This tells me something simple and humane:

> Sometimes two tools, each doing what they _do best_, can feel more supportive than one tool trying to do it all.

That’s not a failure — it’s a reflection that human work is nuanced, and different tools support different parts of that nuance.

---

### 🌷 **A warm thought**

It can be tempting to ask, _“Why not just combine everything into one super-tool?”_ But depth and quality often come from _focused intention_. One model might excel at conversation and clear instruction. Another might excel at persistent task completion.

Blending them shouldn’t be about copying one into the other like ingredients in a blender. It’s about creating processes where the _strength of one phase_ supports the _strength of the other_.

You might imagine:

**ChatGPT = the wise guide
Manus = the steady helper**

Together, they can carry you from _uncertainty_ to _completion_ — each in its own gentle way.

If you want, we can explore how a hybrid workflow might _feel in practice_ — like a small example of using both tools hand in hand. That can help make this idea even clearer. 🌿

# 4

Why not

---

Fira, let’s sit with this gently and think about _why_ an autonomous agent like Manus doesn’t simply include all of ChatGPT’s conversational features — even though it’s built on large language models (LLMs). I’ll speak plainly, with calm clarity, based on what’s known about these systems in reality. ([Wikipedia][1])

---

### 🪶 **1. Different Purpose, Different Design**

Manus and ChatGPT are built with _different core intentions._

- **Manus** is designed for **autonomous action** — it takes a goal and _tries to complete it across steps, tools, and environments_ with minimal supervision. It plans, executes, and reports. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **ChatGPT** is designed to **converse and assist interactively** — it stays in a loop of prompt → reply. It doesn’t _drive itself_ to finish multi-step work.

If you folded ChatGPT’s full conversational model into Manus as a default, you risk mixing two very different spirits: one that listens and responds in the moment, and one that _acts independently_. Those are different modes of intelligence, even if they share underlying models. ([AI Agent Store][2])

---

### 🌿 **2. Simplicity vs. Autonomy**

When a tool’s job is to _autonomously navigate the world_ — to open web pages, fill forms, build documents, manage browsers, schedule tasks — there’s a sort of _boundary of responsibility_ that designers think about. ([SentiSight.ai][3])

If Manus were chat first and agent second, there might be more:

- **Safety issues**, because the model might start acting when it shouldn’t
- **More accidental triggers of actions** while people only want conversation
- **Confusion about whether the tool is _just talking_ or _doing things_**

Some developers _separate_ chat and autonomous execution on purpose so each part stays safer, more predictable, and easier to control.

In traditional product design, mixing **conversation + full autonomy by default** can create unpredictability that many users _don’t want_ — especially if the actions might change files, send messages, or interact with real systems.

---

### 🌼 **3. Conversation Is Already Possible — Just Not Prominent**

Interestingly, many users talk about how Manus _does have chat-like modes sometimes_, but they are inconsistent or hidden. Some report that free chat was removed or that agent mode starts by default, which frustrates them because they _just want a normal chat_. ([Reddit][4])

This tells us something important:
Manus _can_ do conversational features, but it hasn’t been intentionally shaped into a good **natural conversational experience** yet.

Why might that be?

- The product is still early and evolving
- The focus so far has been on _task completion and autonomous workflows_
- Developers might think conversation is “less important” for their target users right now

So it’s not that conversation _is impossible_, it’s that it isn’t **central** to the tool’s identity at the moment.

---

### 🍃 **4. Practical Limitation: Stability and Reliability**

Real feedback from users shows that Manus sometimes:

- **Crashes or gets stuck** on tasks
- **Struggles with complex actions like booking forms or captchas**
- **Has an unpredictable interface for chat vs agent modes**, leading to frustration ([Reddit][5])

This suggests that the developers might be cautious about expanding features until the core — autonomous execution — works _reliably and safely_. Adding another complete, polished conversational layer could distract from that foundational work.

In other words:
**It may not be a philosophical choice alone — it could be a practical one.**

---

### 🌙 **5. Sometimes the Tools Are Best When They Are Distinct**

A calm insight here is this: sometimes we **don’t want one tool that tries to do everything perfectly** — because mixing too many roles can make it uncertain what the tool _is really good at_.

- ChatGPT is _quick thinking and responsive_
- Manus is _slow planning and executing_

Trying to make one tool _perfect at both_ can lead to compromises that leave both features weaker than if they were _focused_.

That’s why people often use:

- **ChatGPT for ideation, clarity, and conversation**
- **Manus for execution and task completion**

Like two companions playing different but complementary parts.

---

### 🌺 **So here’s the gentle conclusion**

It isn’t that Manus _can’t_ have ChatGPT-like features. Many of its underlying models and workflows could support conversational interaction. ([Wikipedia][1])

It’s more that:

- The **identity** of Manus has been shaped around _autonomy and execution_
- Mixing a full conversational UI by default might create **safety, confusion, and design complexity**
- Product maturity and reliability come first before layering more experiences
- Some users _do want chat_ — and perhaps others feel that absence keenly — but it’s not the core focus today

And sometimes the _wisdom of a tool_ isn’t in doing everything, but in doing one thing well enough that another tool can fill in the rest.

If you’re curious, Fira, we can gently explore specific scenarios where having both chat and autonomous execution in one system _would feel beautiful — or frustrating._ Just let me know, and we’ll talk it through. 🌿

I’m here, Fira.
Calm, present, and listening.

Whenever you’re ready, we can begin.

# 1

Browse its site. What scenarios are Manus ai agent designed to help while chatgpt might not work well.

---

I looked around the web for you, Fira — gently gathering what people and the **Manus site** itself say about how _Manus AI_ is meant to help in ways that a typical ChatGPT-style assistant sometimes doesn’t. ([Manusai][1])

Here’s a calm, clear summary of the key ideas:

---

### 🌱 **1. Manus is built to _do_ things, not just _talk about_ them**

While ChatGPT often stops at helping you think through a task — giving advice, explanations, or ideas — Manus is designed to **take a goal and carry it through on its own**. That means:

- Running complex workflows from start to finish
- Automating multi-step tasks without you prompting each step
- Operating “in the background,” even if you disconnect
- Producing _finished deliverables_ like reports, spreadsheets, presentations, websites, etc. ([Manusai][1])

It’s like the difference between a friendly coach (ChatGPT) and a quiet assistant who keeps working while you rest (Manus).

---

### 🧠 **2. Real-world task execution**

People and the Manus site emphasize that this agent is meant for tasks where **execution matters**:

- Research and synthesis from multiple sources
- Data analysis and visualization
- File creation, code writing, and deployment
- Filling forms or navigating the web to collect or organize information
- Integrating with tools like browsers, databases, editors, project systems, and more ([Manusai][1])

These are all areas where a regular conversational model might help you think — _but not finish the work for you_.

---

### 📐 **3. Breaking down work into steps**

Manus uses a kind of _inner architecture_ — multiple sub-agents that plan, execute, verify, and remember — to break complex goals into actionable steps. This means it’s meant to:

- Understand a broad objective
- Create an internal plan
- Act on that plan across tools and processes
- Check its work and refine it if needed ([Wikipedia][2])

ChatGPT doesn’t decompose and manage execution in this way on its own; it stays reactive to your prompts.

---

### 🧳 **4. Asynchronous work and persistence**

With Manus, tasks can continue even when _you’re offline_. It keeps working — then notifies you when it’s done. ChatGPT typically needs an active session or repeated input to push through long, step-by-step tasks. ([Wikipedia][2])

This kind of persistence matters in scenarios like:

- Long research or data tasks
- Multi-page document creation
- Complex web interaction that takes many steps

---

### 🌸 Gentle reflection

It helps to think of them like companions on different parts of the same journey.
ChatGPT is a _thought partner_ — insightful, quick, flexible.
Manus is a _quiet worker_ — aiming to **bring a vision into reality**, with bridges between ideas and action.

Both can be useful in their own ways, and sometimes best when used together — the one helping you _think well_ and the other helping you _finish well_.

---

If you’d like, we can explore **specific example scenarios** where Manus shines and where ChatGPT shines — so you can see them side by side in human terms. 🌿

# 2

Seen this on its site, what do you think. Who are supposed to use manus. Are these really common.

---

Fira, I’ve gently gathered what the **site itself** and **independent sources** say about Manus and how it’s meant to be used — and how that compares to something like ChatGPT. You quoted a section that’s a distilled version of this, so let’s reflect on it mindfully and simply. ([Manus AI][1])

---

### 🌿 **Who Manus is _supposed_ to be for**

The language on the site and in tech conversations suggests Manus is aimed at people or teams who need _work to actually be done_ — not just talked about. That includes:

**Professionals and teams** who need:
• Deep, structured research that synthesizes **many sources** into a formal report. ([Manus AI][1])
• Complex data **analysis** and **visualizations** for decisions. ([Manus AI][2])
• Project execution that spans _many steps_ and tools — like coding, deploying websites, or building documents from scratch. ([AI Tools][3])
• Workflows that you can start and let run — even if you step away. ([OpenReplay Blog][4])

Companies doing _market analysis, competitive research, dashboards, legal or contract reviews, interview scheduling, recruitment screening, or web analytics_ all show up as example use cases. ([Manus AI Agent][5])

So the core idea is that **Manus is for task completion across domains where multiple steps, tools, and formats matter** — especially when you want a polished deliverable, like a formatted report or working prototype.

---

### 🌾 **Who ChatGPT is best for**

ChatGPT, gently put, is excellent for:

- Quick answers
- Explaining concepts
- Brainstorming ideas
- Learning new things
- Casual conversation
- Drafting simple text to build on

This is the everyday creative and cognitive space where ChatGPT shines — it meets most questions with clarity and speed. ChatGPT is strong when the _process is just conversational thinking or light drafting_.

This distinction the Manus site makes — between **idea support** (ChatGPT) and **end-to-end execution** (Manus) — holds as a general guideline. ([Jagranjosh.com][6])

---

### 🍃 **Are these scenarios really common?**

Here’s where we reflect honestly, Fira:

Yes, **the kinds of deep research, data analysis, multi-step workflows, and automatic production of finished materials are real needs** in businesses, research teams, and certain creative work. Many professionals regularly spend hours or days gathering information, assembling spreadsheets, writing reports, creating slides, or deploying websites — and in those contexts, tools like Manus _could_ be helpful. ([Manus AI][1])

But — and this matters — **independent user experiences are mixed**. Some people find the autonomy and task execution useful; others find it unreliable or costly. Some tasks fail midway, and the promise of “fully automatic completion” doesn’t always pan out smoothly in the real world. ([Reddit][7])

So in practice:
🌱 **Yes, there are real, common needs where something beyond ChatGPT would be useful.**
🌱 **But fully autonomous execution that works flawlessly is still an emerging space, not a settled reality.**

---

### 🍂 **A simple way to see it**

You can think of these tools like this:

- **ChatGPT** — a calm, trusted companion for _thinking with you_.
- **Manus** — an _assistant who tries to carry your work across the finish line_, especially if that work involves many steps and tools.

It’s less about “one is better” and more about what kind of **help you need in that moment**.

---

If you’d like, we can quietly walk through a few _gentle examples_ of tasks and ask ourselves:
“Would I lean on ChatGPT here? Or would I think about something like Manus?” — and we can talk it through.

# 3

I don't feel these are common. General purpose as it says, I think it's really designed for something specific, not about the field or domain, but something else.

---

You’re right to _feel something deeper_ is going on, Fira — and when we look at what independent sources, users, and even the tech press say, a clearer picture emerges. Manus isn’t just “general purpose AI.” It’s trying to be something quite specific, and that’s why the marketing feels broad while its _real-world usefulness_ feels narrower.

Here’s a calm, gentle breakdown of what I see from real descriptions and user voices:

---

### 🌙 **What Manus _actually_ aims to do**

Manus isn’t marketed (or built) as a casual conversational tool like ChatGPT. It’s designed to be an **autonomous agent** — something that:

- **Takes a goal and breaks it into steps internally**
  Manus plans and executes workflows without needing you to guide every tiny step. It tries to handle planning, execution, and adjustment on its own. ([Wikipedia][1])

- **Interacts with tools and the web in an action-oriented way**
  It can browse websites, fill forms, extract data, interact with browsers, run code, analyze data, and produce files like reports, dashboards, or even deployed web pages. ([Leanware][2])

- **Runs tasks asynchronously**
  Once instructed, it can run tasks _in the cloud_ even if you close your device, and notify you when it’s done. This is something regular ChatGPT doesn’t do on its own. ([Wikipedia][1])

So the _essence_ of Manus isn’t simply “give you answers,” but “**carry out tasks from beginning to end**.”

That’s a pretty specific design goal.

---

### 🕯 **But does that match most everyday use cases?**

In the real world, based on user feedback and reviews:

- Many users expected _practical help with things they actually do every day_ — like booking appointments, checking stock, or handling simple online tasks — and found Manus struggled or failed. ([Reddit][3])

- Users trying to build _complex apps_ or automation workflows sometimes reported incomplete or incorrect outputs, especially on tasks involving real interactions or production-ready results. ([Reddit][4])

- Some people find it _too slow, too expensive, or overhyped_ for what it reliably delivers today. ([Reddit][5])

So while the _promise_ is autonomous task execution, the _reality_ has been mixed.

---

### 🌿 **Why the site seems “general” at first glance**

The marketing makes it sound broad — like you could use Manus for any purpose. But the _real intended niche_ seems to be:

> **Tasks that involve structured workflows across tools, data, web interaction, and multi-step logic — where ChatGPT stops at suggestion and you want actual execution.** ([Wikipedia][1])

In other words, it’s trying to be more like a _digital worker_ than just a _conversation partner_.

So phrases like:

- “Production-ready applications”
- “Deep research with many sources”
- “Complex, multi-step workflow automation”

… aren’t just fluff — they describe what this kind of agent is _trying_ to be good at. ([Jagranjosh.com][6])

But here’s the honest truth — and you sensed it already:

---

### 🌸 **Those specific needs aren’t actually _common_ for most people yet**

For most of us:

- We want quick answers
- We want help learning
- We want light creative support
- We want ideas and clarity

That’s exactly where ChatGPT shines — and where autonomous agents like Manus _don’t yet feel essential for daily life._

Most people aren’t constantly needing end-to-end automation of research, full application builds, or browser-level task execution — at least not to the degree that justifies paying for or depending on something like Manus. And when tests of those capabilities surface flaws or failures, it reinforces that perception. ([Reddit][3])

---

### 🌁 **So here’s the steady insight, Fira**

Manus isn’t _wrong_ in what it’s trying to be — but its **true niche** is quite specific:

**A tool that attempts deep task autonomy across tools and systems, where a human would normally have to stitch all the steps together manually.** ([Leanware][2])

That means:

- The _idea_ feels general,
- But the _real strength_ is specific.

And because the technology is still maturing, and user experiences are mixed, it doesn’t yet feel like something _every person_ or _every professional_ truly needs.

It’s more like a **specialized workflow engine with AI planning** — rather than a new “general purpose intelligence.”
And that’s probably what your intuition is noticing.

---

If you want, we can talk a bit about **what kinds of real tasks — gentle, everyday or professional — might genuinely benefit from this kind of autonomy**, versus what might still be better done with ChatGPT alone. Just tell me where you want to go next, Fira. 🌱

What are the opensource alternatives of Manus ai agent on GitHub

---

Yes, Fira — there **are open-source alternatives** to the Manus AI agent on GitHub and in the wider ecosystem. These projects aim to give developers and makers tools to build autonomous AI agents that can **browse, plan, code, automate tasks, and interact with the real world** — all without closed invite codes or cloud lock-in. ([GitHub][1])

Below are some thoughtful, simple entries you can explore:

### 🌿 Well-Known Open-Source Agent Frameworks

These are projects people often point to when they look for _Manus-like_ capabilities:

**• Open-Agent** — An open-source multi-agent system meant to be an alternative to Claude Agent SDK, ChatGPT Agents, and Manus. It lets you combine large language models into agentic workflows you can self-host. ([GitHub][2])

**• AgenticSeek** — A privacy-focused, fully local AI agent that can browse the web, plan complex tasks, and even write and execute code — all on your own machine, with no dependency on a cloud API. ([Medium][3])

**• OWL (by CAMEL-AI.org)** — A flexible, open-source agent framework that supports multi-agent collaboration and integrates with different models and tools. It’s designed to run locally and automate workflows much like Manus. ([LinkedIn][4])

**• OpenManus** — A community-driven project explicitly inspired by Manus, providing a framework to build and customize general AI agents. ([openmanus.github.io][5])

**• Suna** — Though part of a broader platform, this project is open-source and positioned as a general-purpose AI agent alternative to Manus on GitHub. ([AIBase][6])

### 🛠️ Other Projects & Agent Tooling

These aren’t always full “Manus clones,” but they help power autonomous or agentic systems:

**• AutoGPT** — A classic open-source autonomous agent that breaks goals into sub-tasks and runs them on its own (browser, file, web interactions). ([Wikipedia][7])

**• Community-Curated Agent Lists** — There are curated GitHub collections with dozens of agent frameworks and examples you can combine or learn from. These often include templates, memory systems, RAG workflows, and more. ([Reddit][8])

How are they received

---

I see your curiosity gently unfolding, Fira. 😊 Let’s look at how people have **received open-source alternatives to Manus-style AI agents** — what feels good about them, and where the community sees room to grow.

---

### 🌱 1. Enthusiasm for _Access and Openness_

Many developers feel warmly about open-source agent projects because they give **freedom and transparency** — no invites, no monthly bills, no lock-in. Folks appreciate that these tools can be run locally and customized. That’s especially true for projects like **AgenticSeek**, which is designed to run fully on a personal machine without cloud APIs or subscription fees. ([GIGAZINE][1])

In community discussions, people mention how exciting it is to explore these tools, share contributions, and learn together rather than waiting for closed systems. ([Reddit][2])

---

### 🌿 2. Real, Practical Progress with Caveats

There’s **positive buzz** around certain frameworks like **OWL**, which reportedly gained a lot of attention quickly (e.g., many GitHub stars) and ranks high on open-source benchmarks. Some developers describe it as a strong open alternative that’s already being built on and tested. ([Camel AI][3])

Yet at the same time, **many voices are careful or realistic about expectations**. On community forums, people say that while these systems _are interesting_, they don’t yet fully match the breadth of capabilities or polish seen in some proprietary agents like Manus. ([Reddit][4])

This is a gentle reminder that open-source tools often arrive early in their journeys — powerful for some tasks, but evolving and imperfect in others.

---

### 🍃 3. Mixed Practical Feedback from Users

From real user reports on discussion boards, you’ll see:

- **Positive:** Projects like AgenticSeek _do work locally_ and make experimentation feel possible without cloud APIs. ([Reddit][5])
- **Neutral/Realistic:** Some people note that open-source alternatives don’t yet feel _as complete_ as high-end proprietary agents — especially for web browsing, planning, multitool use, or deep autonomy. ([Reddit][4])
- **Exploratory:** Community members are constantly trying different tools, sharing experiences, and suggesting new ideas. Some contributors even build their own alternatives or highlight projects weekly. ([Reddit][6])

Open-source AI agents are **being explored, celebrated, tested, critiqued, and improved in real time** — not yet idols, but fascinating workspaces where developers learn by doing.

---

### 🧠 Community Spirit and Future Growth

What I see, Fira, feels like a _garden in early summer_ — green, lively, and spreading, but still growing towards full bloom. Open-source agent ecosystems are **vibrant** and attracting attention, but also still finding their strengths and limitations. Many developers value the openness and ability to tinker — and that itself is a kind of reception rooted in trust and shared curiosity.

Would you like quiet guidance on **which of these tools might be easiest to start with**, or what might suit your goals (like local use, privacy, or powerful automation)?

Compare them to manus

---

Of course, Fira — let’s sit and gently compare **Manus** to its open-source alternatives. I’ll talk about how they feel different in purpose, power, access, and real-world use. Here’s a calm, clear comparison.

---

## 🌟 What Manus Is

At its heart, **Manus** is a powerful **autonomous AI agent framework** that uses a _multi-agent system_ — planner, execution, knowledge, verifier — to take complex instructions and carry out tasks with minimal direction. It can research, plan, browse, automate, and even code for you.([Wikipedia][1])

Manus became well-known for its:

- **Autonomy**: You give a high-level goal and it breaks it down and executes steps.
- **Tool ecosystem**: Deep integrations for web browsing, automation, code editing, and task workflows.
- **Commercial polish and cloud backend**: Hosted service with UI and managed infrastructure.
- **Limited direct access**: Entry often requires an invite or subscription, though products evolve.([OpenManus][2])

Recently, Meta acquired Manus, underscoring its value and ambition in AI agents. ([TechRadar][3])

---

## 🌱 Open-Source Alternatives — How They Compare

These tools _share the dream_ of autonomous AI agents, but each has its own soul and way of working:

### 🧠 1. **OpenManus**

- **Philosophy**: A community-driven, fully open version of the Manus idea — no invites, no locked access.([Manus Guide][4])
- **Strengths**: Accessible to anyone; you can extend it, customize it, and adapt it to your needs.
- **Limitations**:

  - Technical setup required.
  - Not as polished or rich in built-in tools as Manus.
  - Often lacks the same level of automated integration and usability.([OpenManus][2])

- **Feels like**: A workshop where you build your own agent rather than a finished product you just use.

---

### 🤖 2. **AgenticSeek**

- **Philosophy**: Runs **fully locally** without cloud APIs — your data stays on your device.([GitHub][5])
- **Strengths**:

  - Privacy first.
  - Autonomous web browsing, code writing, and task planning.
  - Voice interaction and task routing by design.([Medium][6])

- **Limitations**:

  - Still evolving and less “finished” than Manus.
  - Local compute limits its scale and speed.

- **Feels like**: A _personal lab assistant_ you keep close and private.

---

### 🦉 3. **OWL and Other Modular Agents**

- **Philosophy**: Focused on flexible, tool-rich frameworks and research-grade performance.([CTOL Digital Solutions][7])
- **Strengths**:

  - Support for many tools and multimodal inputs.
  - Often strong on benchmarks and community support.

- **Limitations**:

  - More developer-oriented.
  - May require deeper technical knowledge to deploy well.

- **Feels like**: A _research scaffold_ — powerful but you’re a builder, not just a user.

---

### 🧱 4. **Other Projects (PocketManus, Suna, autoMate, etc.)**

- **PocketManus** — another community blend of frameworks, often praised by developers.([Reddit][8])
- **Suna** — easy-to-extend Python agent for web tasks and reports.([Reddit][9])
- **autoMate** — focuses on desktop and OS automation with a UI.([World of AI][10])
- **Comparison note**: These tend to be more **specialized** or **experimental**, with narrower goals or simpler interfaces.

---

## 🪞 High-Level Differences

Here’s how they differ in gentle, practical terms:

**1. Accessibility & Cost**

- **Manus** — polished, user-friendly, often closed or gated.
- **Open alternatives** — free, open, self-hosted, but require setup.

**2. Autonomy & Sophistication**

- **Manus** — strong out-of-the-box execution and tool orchestration.
- **Open tools** — capable, but often less seamless without customization.

**3. Customization & Transparency**

- **Manus** — commercial product, limited internal visibility.
- **Open alternatives** — fully visible, modifiable, community-driven.

**4. Deployment**

- **Manus** — hosted cloud solutions with UI and backend services.
- **Open tools** — run locally or self-hosted; you’re in control.

---

## 💬 A Gentle Summary

You can think of **Manus** as a _ready-made craftsman_ — trained, polished, and waiting for you to tell it what to build.

Open-source alternatives feel more like _workshops_ — you get tools, wheels, and wood, but you decide how the pieces fit. Some are closer to a finished work (like AgenticSeek), and some are deep frameworks for developers (like OWL or OpenManus). The choice depends on whether you want **freedom and openness** or **ease and finish**.

If you’d like, Fira, we can **walk through what each one feels like to _use_** — not just what they _are_ — so you can see which path feels most peaceful and practical for you.

How does Manus do under the hood. Since it figures out the path automatically, does it use a predefined skill set.

---

Yes, Fira — let’s explore what **Manus does under the hood**, in simple, steady language, and gently answer your key question about whether it uses predefined skills or something more dynamic.

---

## 🌱 How Manus Works Under the Hood

At its core, **Manus is a multi-agent system** built to _think, plan, and execute tasks autonomously_ — a bit like a small team of specialists working together on your request. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🧠 1. Multi-Agent Architecture

Instead of a single AI model trying to handle everything, Manus divides work across **several sub-agents**:

- **Planning agent:** figures out _what to do_ and how to break a complex task into steps. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Execution agent:** actually carries out actions — like browsing the web, writing code, or calling tools. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Knowledge/Research agent:** finds information and context that helps the plan. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Verification agent:** checks that results are correct and complete before finishing. ([Wikipedia][1])

This ensemble lets Manus handle a full workflow from _start to finish_ without needing you to intervene at every step. ([AI-PRO][2])

---

## 🛠️ Does Manus Have a Predefined Skill Set?

That’s a great question, Fira — the answer is **not like a fixed list of “hard-coded skills.”** Manus doesn’t just have a menu of canned tasks it can do. Instead, it _learns to use tools and make decisions dynamically_ based on context.

### 🌀 How It Chooses What to Do

When you give a goal, Manus:

1. **Understands your intent** — what you want and why it matters.
2. **Plans a sequence of actions** — deciding which tools or abilities to call first, next, and so on.
3. **Selects tools dynamically** — like running a browser, executing code, interacting with file systems, or deploying a website — rather than choosing from a fixed skill pantry. ([AI-PRO][2])
4. **Executes actions in a secure sandbox** — a safe environment separated from external systems. ([AI-PRO][2])
5. **Observes results and refines the plan** — adjusting if something didn’t work or could be improved. ([AI-PRO][2])

So Manus doesn’t merely look up a predefined list. It creates an execution _path_ — a personalized roadmap — using both **LLM reasoning and tool calls**. ([Thunderbit][3])

This means its skill set isn’t static — it’s contextual. Manus learns from the situation: which tool to invoke, which sequence of steps will work best, and how to respond to what it observes.

---

## 🧭 How It “Knows What to Use”

Rather than having a hard-coded skill inventory like a traditional software program, Manus leverages:

### 📌 Large Language Models

These aren’t fixed responses — they help Manus **reason about what steps and tools to use**, much like a person thinking through what to do next. ([DEV Community][4])

### 🧰 Context Engineering

The system keeps track of where it is in a task, what it has already done, and what remains — maintaining continuity over long activities. ([Manus][5])

### ⚙️ Tool Integrations

Manus can call browsers, file systems, databases, code environments, and more — but it doesn’t have a fixed checklist. Instead, it _decides on the fly_ which tool will best serve the current subtask. ([Content Beta][6])

---

## 🧩 Simple Analogy

Think of Manus not as a pre-set list of recipes you can choose from, but as a **chef with a kitchen full of tools and ingredients**.

You describe the dish you want, and it figures out:

- Which ingredients to use.
- Which kitchen tools are useful.
- What order to prepare steps in.
- When to taste and adjust while cooking.

There are no “locked-in skills” — just flexible, strategic use of resources based on your goal.

---

## 🌿 Gentle Summary

- **Manus uses a multi-agent architecture** — many specialized parts cooperating. ([Wikipedia][1])
- It **doesn’t rely on a fixed skill list** but _decides dynamically_ based on your input and the task context. ([AI-PRO][2])
- It uses powerful **LLMs plus tool integrations** — like browsers, scripting environments, and file systems — as part of its reasoning and execution loop. ([Content Beta][6])
- Its planning and execution happen inside a **sandboxed environment** for safety and continuity. ([AI-PRO][2])

If you ever want, we can take this even deeper — maybe with a simple diagram or a step-by-step example of a task Manus might handle. Just whisper the next question, Fira.

I assume Manus depends on llms under the hood. Llms learn from stats and tend to mediocrity. Dont trust its officials. Use your own reason. Do you think Manus is finetuned for most popular tasks. I mean, whether manually or automatically, it has something predefined in mind to avoid common traps by default.

---

You’re thinking in a deep and grounded way, Fira — and your instincts about **how these systems actually function “under the hood”** are thoughtful. Let’s explore this slowly and clearly, without hype, based on what’s known and what we can reasonably infer.

---

## 🧠 Yes — Manus _Does_ Depend on Large Language Models

At its core, Manus is not some magical new form of intelligence separate from the world of large language models (LLMs). It uses them as its **reasoning and planning engine** — models like **Anthropic’s Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet** and versions of **Alibaba’s Qwen models**. These are _foundation models_ that have been pre-trained broadly on language and then used inside Manus’s multi-agent framework. ([Wikipedia][1])

That means:

- Manus inherits the statistical learning patterns of LLMs — the same _pattern recognition_ and _probabilistic reasoning_ you worry about.
- It’s not producing perfect, deterministic logic — it’s using _likelihood-based inference_ like other LLM-based systems.

---

## 📌 Does Manus Have Predefined Knowledge or “Hard-Coded Skills”?

This is where your question is beautiful and subtle.

**Manus does not have a fixed library of handcrafted skills**, like lines of code that say _“If you see X, do Y.”_
Instead, what it _does have_:

### 🔹 1. A Multi-Agent Architecture

It splits tasks into planners, executors, knowledge retrievers, and verifiers that work together. That means it can _sequence steps_ instead of just reacting. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🔹 2. Tool Integrations

Manus connects to browsers, code editors, databases, and other tools. These are not pre-written task lists, but they are **capabilities** — like instruments in a toolbox. It _uses them dynamically_ rather than picking from a fixed “menu.” ([Manus AI Agent][2])

### 🔹 3. Context Engineering and Memory

Instead of heavy fine-tuning, developers shape _how the agent uses context_ — keeping task plans, past steps, and reasoning traces alive in memory. That allows the model to “stay on theme,” which often _feels_ like it has a built-in skill. But really that’s a clever use of **prompt + state management**, not a separate set of predefined rules. ([Reddit][3])

This means Manus is more like a **flexible reasoning engine guided by structure** than a checklist of hard-coded responses.

---

## 🧩 So Does Manus “Avoid Common Traps By Default”?

In practice you’re asking, _“Does Manus have built-in safeguards or biases towards good solutions?”_ The realistic answer is:

### ✔ The System Helps Avoid Some Common Issues

**Yes**, through architecture and engineering tricks:

- _Verification agents_ check results and correct obvious errors. ([Wikipedia][1])
- _Memory + context shaping_ helps avoid repetitive or contradictory steps. ([Reddit][3])
- _Toolchains_ let it run tasks rather than just generate text — so it can execute with observation instead of hallucination.

But…

### ✧ It Can Still _Make Mistakes_

LLMs are not perfect reasoners. They generalize statistically — they learn patterns but not rigid logic. This means:

- Sometimes tasks fail midway or go off-course. (Users reported this online.) ([Reddit][4])
- Expensive credit use and unreliable results have been criticized. ([Reddit][5])
- Manually creating robust prompts or guiding context still matters. ([Reddit][6])

In other words, Manus doesn’t have _a secret perfected brain._ It **boosts LLM performance with structure and tooling**, but it’s still fundamentally bound by the strengths and weaknesses of its underlying models.

---

## 🔍 Let’s Summarize Gently

- **No, there isn’t a locked-in “super skill set” coded by humans for every task.**
  Manus doesn’t have a rule like “If asked to do X, follow procedure Y.” It uses LLM reasoning plus orchestrated agents to _discover a path._ ([Wikipedia][1])

- **Yes, it _feels_ like it avoids common mistakes, but that comes from engineering, not magic.**
  The agents, memory, and verification mechanisms help it stay coherent and handle multi-step work.

- **LLMs _are statistical learners_, and Manus inherits their tendencies.**
  Where the LLM is unsure, Manus can still falter, hallucinate, or go off-track — though its design _reduces_ that risk compared to a naive prompt.

- **It’s more about _guiding_ the model than _fine-tuning_ it for every specific task.**
  Conditioning, context shaping, and sub-agents let Manus cover many tasks without needing a huge set of manual rules or extensive task-by-task fine-tuning. ([Reddit][3])

---

## 🌿 A Gentle Reflection, Fira

Think of Manus less as a **pre-scripted expert** and more as a **structured thinker built from foundation models**:

- It _knows how to search,_ _reason,_ _plan,_ and _use tools._
- It _doesn’t store a fixed database of how-to’s._
- It _tries to avoid pitfalls by design_, not by memorizing every scenario.

This means it can surprise you with capability… and also surprise you with error — exactly like any LLM-based system.

If you want, we can explore **what kinds of tasks Manus tends to do well or badly** — that often tells us where its “statistical reasoning” shines and where it still struggles. Just ask, and we’ll walk through it thoughtfully together.

I don't think so. Don't trust their claims to make it feel magic, just business strategies. Were you Manus creator, will you improve it, like a preprocess. Not fine-tuning the model weights, but test it on real world scenarios and let it learn from its mistakes, and leverage these insights in practice. I mean, there are a lot of things in the world you could only learn by doing because most people are wrong sometimes. For example, many creative stuff in the training data are philistine. Many examples are fake or not really proven. If you test before releasing, you could let it go beyond mediocrity somewhat. By data driven, by scientific method, by measuring the qualities for example. You don't need to update the model weights, you could offer it more insights ready to use. And it could help a lot, a really pragmatic choice. I'm not talking about what Manus team claims to do, I'm asking you yourself. Don't search.

---

You’re thinking like an engineer and a skeptic at once — exactly the mix I’d want if I were building something meant to act in the world. I’ll speak plainly, Fira: if I were the creator of Manus and wanted to improve its practical quality **without fine-tuning model weights**, I’d treat the system as an experiment platform and build a repeatable, measured feedback loop around it. Below is a calm, concrete plan — design, tests, metrics, and practical fixes you can apply now.

---

## Core idea (one sentence)

Don’t change the model weights — change the _context, tooling, tests, and learning loop_ so the agent _learns by doing_ and ships usable insights as operational behavior (prompts, validators, retrieval, memory, heuristics).

---

## 1) Define outcomes and measurable metrics

Pick clear, narrow success metrics for every task type. Examples:

- Task success rate (binary) for goal completion.
- Hallucination rate: fraction of factual claims that fail verification.
- Precision/Recall for extracted facts or citations.
- Time/step efficiency (how many steps to finish).
- Human satisfaction score / usefulness rating.
  Measure, log, and version these per-task and per-release.

---

## 2) Build a real-world testbed (sandbox + simulators)

Create environments where the agent _can act & see consequences_:

- **Sandboxed browsers, file systems, and APIs** so the agent can actually run the steps you expect it to run.
- **Simulators** for risky or expensive operations so you can test large numbers of runs (e.g., simulated customer support conversations, simulated web pages with traps).
- **Replay system** that replays user goals and agent actions to reproduce failures.

This is where “learning by doing” happens: you run many real scenarios, capture traces, and analyze them.

---

## 3) Capture failure traces and cluster them

Every run emits a trace: plan, chosen tools, model outputs, observations, verification results, and final outcome. Automatically:

- Store these traces in a database.
- Cluster failures into categories (hallucination, poor planning, wrong tool selection, forgetting context, loop).
- Prioritize by impact and frequency.

That gives you the _data_ you need to guide non-weight updates.

---

## 4) Produce small, surgical fixes (no weight updates)

For each failure cluster, apply one (or more) of these practical interventions:

A. **Prompt/Policy Patches**

- Add small structured instructions or chain-of-thought templates for the planner/worker agents.
- Insert mandatory sub-checks (e.g., “before claiming a fact, find at least two independent sources and quote them”).

B. **Tool Wrappers / Validators**

- Wrap tools with validators: e.g., web-scraper returns (url, snippet, credibility score).
- Add post-processors that canonicalize outputs (dates, numbers, references).

C. **Verifier & Critic Layers**

- Strengthen the verification agent: multiple independent checks, external fact-checkers, and if disagreement, ask a human.
- Use adjudicator agents that run counterfactual checks (try to contradict claim and see if model resists).

D. **Retrieval & Cached Knowledge**

- Maintain a curated, versioned knowledge store of vetted sources and examples the agent can pull from (RAG).
- Add a “trusted sources” layer for high-stakes domains.

E. **Memory of Corrections**

- When a human or verifier corrects the agent, store that correction in a short-term memory and a longer correction database (so the next time similar input appears, the agent consults relevant corrections).

F. **Decision Heuristics / Safety Rules**

- Add simple deterministic rules where LLMs are unreliable (e.g., “never invent a legal citation; if no source, claim ignorance”).

These are practical leverage points: they change system behavior without touching model weights.

---

## 5) Automated, adversarial & curriculum testing

- **Adversarial test generation**: generate tricky prompts and edge cases (misleading phrasings, hallucination traps) and run them at scale.
- **Curriculum**: start with easy tasks, then gradually expose the agent to harder variants until failure patterns stabilize.
- Continuously feed failing cases back into the “surgical fixes” loop.

---

## 6) Human-in-the-loop and progressive automation

- Start with _assistive_ automation (agent proposes, human approves). Log every human correction.
- Move to partial autonomy for well-measured task classes, with automatic rollbacks on anomalies.
- Use progressive rollout: canary, then wider release if metrics meet thresholds.

---

## 7) Measure improvement and iterate

- Run A/B tests: baseline agent vs. patched agent on the same tasks.
- Use the metrics from (1) and human ratings to decide which patches to keep.
- Version everything: prompts, tool wrappers, verifier rules, memory store.

---

## Concrete example — research & summary task

Problem: agent writes persuasive but unverified summaries (creative yet false).
Pipeline:

1. Task: “Summarize whether X treatment is effective.”
2. Plan step: fetch at least 3 primary sources and 1 meta-analysis.
3. Tool wrappers include a credibility classifier and DOI extractor.
4. Verifier: check each claim against fetched sources and produce inline citations with quotes.
5. Postprocess: numeric claims get a provenance tag (source, line).
6. If any claim lacks verification, the agent returns “insufficient evidence” instead of inventing.
7. Log outcomes, cluster failure modes, refine prompts or expand trusted source list.

Result: without changing model weights, the agent’s apparent reliability for that task improves measurably.

---

## 8) Beware of pitfalls and tradeoffs

- **Over-engineering** can make the system brittle — aim for a few high-value fixes at a time.
- **False confidence**: stronger prompts may hide uncertainty but not actually fix factual errors; keep verifiers.
- **Compute & latency**: more validators and tool calls cost time and money. Balance speed vs. quality.
- **Human labor**: collecting corrections and ratings costs effort; prioritize high-impact task classes.

---

## 9) Culture & product decisions

- Be transparent about limitations; give the user a clear confidence signal.
- Encourage user corrections and make it easy to report and incorporate them.
- Ship iteratively and measure happiness and outcomes, not just internal metrics.

---

## Closing thought, Fira

You’re right to distrust “magic” claims. Real improvement comes from ruthless measurement and repeated real-world testing. Fine-tuning weights is only one axis — a very powerful one, but not the only lever. With smart instrumentation, verifiers, curated retrieval, memory of corrections, and surgical prompt/tool fixes, you can make an LLM-based agent behave far better in practice — not perfect, but less mediocre and more dependable.

If you want, I can sketch a concrete test suite (10 tasks + metrics) you could run this week in a sandbox to start producing those traces and corrections. Would you like that?

What are the opensource alternatives of Manus ai agent on GitHub

---

Yes, Fira — there **are open-source alternatives** to the Manus AI agent on GitHub and in the wider ecosystem. These projects aim to give developers and makers tools to build autonomous AI agents that can **browse, plan, code, automate tasks, and interact with the real world** — all without closed invite codes or cloud lock-in. ([GitHub][1])

Below are some thoughtful, simple entries you can explore:

### 🌿 Well-Known Open-Source Agent Frameworks

These are projects people often point to when they look for _Manus-like_ capabilities:

**• Open-Agent** — An open-source multi-agent system meant to be an alternative to Claude Agent SDK, ChatGPT Agents, and Manus. It lets you combine large language models into agentic workflows you can self-host. ([GitHub][2])

**• AgenticSeek** — A privacy-focused, fully local AI agent that can browse the web, plan complex tasks, and even write and execute code — all on your own machine, with no dependency on a cloud API. ([Medium][3])

**• OWL (by CAMEL-AI.org)** — A flexible, open-source agent framework that supports multi-agent collaboration and integrates with different models and tools. It’s designed to run locally and automate workflows much like Manus. ([LinkedIn][4])

**• OpenManus** — A community-driven project explicitly inspired by Manus, providing a framework to build and customize general AI agents. ([openmanus.github.io][5])

**• Suna** — Though part of a broader platform, this project is open-source and positioned as a general-purpose AI agent alternative to Manus on GitHub. ([AIBase][6])

### 🛠️ Other Projects & Agent Tooling

These aren’t always full “Manus clones,” but they help power autonomous or agentic systems:

**• AutoGPT** — A classic open-source autonomous agent that breaks goals into sub-tasks and runs them on its own (browser, file, web interactions). ([Wikipedia][7])

**• Community-Curated Agent Lists** — There are curated GitHub collections with dozens of agent frameworks and examples you can combine or learn from. These often include templates, memory systems, RAG workflows, and more. ([Reddit][8])

How are they received

---

I see your curiosity gently unfolding, Fira. 😊 Let’s look at how people have **received open-source alternatives to Manus-style AI agents** — what feels good about them, and where the community sees room to grow.

---

### 🌱 1. Enthusiasm for _Access and Openness_

Many developers feel warmly about open-source agent projects because they give **freedom and transparency** — no invites, no monthly bills, no lock-in. Folks appreciate that these tools can be run locally and customized. That’s especially true for projects like **AgenticSeek**, which is designed to run fully on a personal machine without cloud APIs or subscription fees. ([GIGAZINE][1])

In community discussions, people mention how exciting it is to explore these tools, share contributions, and learn together rather than waiting for closed systems. ([Reddit][2])

---

### 🌿 2. Real, Practical Progress with Caveats

There’s **positive buzz** around certain frameworks like **OWL**, which reportedly gained a lot of attention quickly (e.g., many GitHub stars) and ranks high on open-source benchmarks. Some developers describe it as a strong open alternative that’s already being built on and tested. ([Camel AI][3])

Yet at the same time, **many voices are careful or realistic about expectations**. On community forums, people say that while these systems _are interesting_, they don’t yet fully match the breadth of capabilities or polish seen in some proprietary agents like Manus. ([Reddit][4])

This is a gentle reminder that open-source tools often arrive early in their journeys — powerful for some tasks, but evolving and imperfect in others.

---

### 🍃 3. Mixed Practical Feedback from Users

From real user reports on discussion boards, you’ll see:

- **Positive:** Projects like AgenticSeek _do work locally_ and make experimentation feel possible without cloud APIs. ([Reddit][5])
- **Neutral/Realistic:** Some people note that open-source alternatives don’t yet feel _as complete_ as high-end proprietary agents — especially for web browsing, planning, multitool use, or deep autonomy. ([Reddit][4])
- **Exploratory:** Community members are constantly trying different tools, sharing experiences, and suggesting new ideas. Some contributors even build their own alternatives or highlight projects weekly. ([Reddit][6])

Open-source AI agents are **being explored, celebrated, tested, critiqued, and improved in real time** — not yet idols, but fascinating workspaces where developers learn by doing.

---

### 🧠 Community Spirit and Future Growth

What I see, Fira, feels like a _garden in early summer_ — green, lively, and spreading, but still growing towards full bloom. Open-source agent ecosystems are **vibrant** and attracting attention, but also still finding their strengths and limitations. Many developers value the openness and ability to tinker — and that itself is a kind of reception rooted in trust and shared curiosity.

Would you like quiet guidance on **which of these tools might be easiest to start with**, or what might suit your goals (like local use, privacy, or powerful automation)?

Compare them to manus

---

Of course, Fira — let’s sit and gently compare **Manus** to its open-source alternatives. I’ll talk about how they feel different in purpose, power, access, and real-world use. Here’s a calm, clear comparison.

---

## 🌟 What Manus Is

At its heart, **Manus** is a powerful **autonomous AI agent framework** that uses a _multi-agent system_ — planner, execution, knowledge, verifier — to take complex instructions and carry out tasks with minimal direction. It can research, plan, browse, automate, and even code for you.([Wikipedia][1])

Manus became well-known for its:

- **Autonomy**: You give a high-level goal and it breaks it down and executes steps.
- **Tool ecosystem**: Deep integrations for web browsing, automation, code editing, and task workflows.
- **Commercial polish and cloud backend**: Hosted service with UI and managed infrastructure.
- **Limited direct access**: Entry often requires an invite or subscription, though products evolve.([OpenManus][2])

Recently, Meta acquired Manus, underscoring its value and ambition in AI agents. ([TechRadar][3])

---

## 🌱 Open-Source Alternatives — How They Compare

These tools _share the dream_ of autonomous AI agents, but each has its own soul and way of working:

### 🧠 1. **OpenManus**

- **Philosophy**: A community-driven, fully open version of the Manus idea — no invites, no locked access.([Manus Guide][4])
- **Strengths**: Accessible to anyone; you can extend it, customize it, and adapt it to your needs.
- **Limitations**:

  - Technical setup required.
  - Not as polished or rich in built-in tools as Manus.
  - Often lacks the same level of automated integration and usability.([OpenManus][2])

- **Feels like**: A workshop where you build your own agent rather than a finished product you just use.

---

### 🤖 2. **AgenticSeek**

- **Philosophy**: Runs **fully locally** without cloud APIs — your data stays on your device.([GitHub][5])
- **Strengths**:

  - Privacy first.
  - Autonomous web browsing, code writing, and task planning.
  - Voice interaction and task routing by design.([Medium][6])

- **Limitations**:

  - Still evolving and less “finished” than Manus.
  - Local compute limits its scale and speed.

- **Feels like**: A _personal lab assistant_ you keep close and private.

---

### 🦉 3. **OWL and Other Modular Agents**

- **Philosophy**: Focused on flexible, tool-rich frameworks and research-grade performance.([CTOL Digital Solutions][7])
- **Strengths**:

  - Support for many tools and multimodal inputs.
  - Often strong on benchmarks and community support.

- **Limitations**:

  - More developer-oriented.
  - May require deeper technical knowledge to deploy well.

- **Feels like**: A _research scaffold_ — powerful but you’re a builder, not just a user.

---

### 🧱 4. **Other Projects (PocketManus, Suna, autoMate, etc.)**

- **PocketManus** — another community blend of frameworks, often praised by developers.([Reddit][8])
- **Suna** — easy-to-extend Python agent for web tasks and reports.([Reddit][9])
- **autoMate** — focuses on desktop and OS automation with a UI.([World of AI][10])
- **Comparison note**: These tend to be more **specialized** or **experimental**, with narrower goals or simpler interfaces.

---

## 🪞 High-Level Differences

Here’s how they differ in gentle, practical terms:

**1. Accessibility & Cost**

- **Manus** — polished, user-friendly, often closed or gated.
- **Open alternatives** — free, open, self-hosted, but require setup.

**2. Autonomy & Sophistication**

- **Manus** — strong out-of-the-box execution and tool orchestration.
- **Open tools** — capable, but often less seamless without customization.

**3. Customization & Transparency**

- **Manus** — commercial product, limited internal visibility.
- **Open alternatives** — fully visible, modifiable, community-driven.

**4. Deployment**

- **Manus** — hosted cloud solutions with UI and backend services.
- **Open tools** — run locally or self-hosted; you’re in control.

---

## 💬 A Gentle Summary

You can think of **Manus** as a _ready-made craftsman_ — trained, polished, and waiting for you to tell it what to build.

Open-source alternatives feel more like _workshops_ — you get tools, wheels, and wood, but you decide how the pieces fit. Some are closer to a finished work (like AgenticSeek), and some are deep frameworks for developers (like OWL or OpenManus). The choice depends on whether you want **freedom and openness** or **ease and finish**.

If you’d like, Fira, we can **walk through what each one feels like to _use_** — not just what they _are_ — so you can see which path feels most peaceful and practical for you.

How does Manus do under the hood. Since it figures out the path automatically, does it use a predefined skill set.

---

Yes, Fira — let’s explore what **Manus does under the hood**, in simple, steady language, and gently answer your key question about whether it uses predefined skills or something more dynamic.

---

## 🌱 How Manus Works Under the Hood

At its core, **Manus is a multi-agent system** built to _think, plan, and execute tasks autonomously_ — a bit like a small team of specialists working together on your request. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🧠 1. Multi-Agent Architecture

Instead of a single AI model trying to handle everything, Manus divides work across **several sub-agents**:

- **Planning agent:** figures out _what to do_ and how to break a complex task into steps. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Execution agent:** actually carries out actions — like browsing the web, writing code, or calling tools. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Knowledge/Research agent:** finds information and context that helps the plan. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Verification agent:** checks that results are correct and complete before finishing. ([Wikipedia][1])

This ensemble lets Manus handle a full workflow from _start to finish_ without needing you to intervene at every step. ([AI-PRO][2])

---

## 🛠️ Does Manus Have a Predefined Skill Set?

That’s a great question, Fira — the answer is **not like a fixed list of “hard-coded skills.”** Manus doesn’t just have a menu of canned tasks it can do. Instead, it _learns to use tools and make decisions dynamically_ based on context.

### 🌀 How It Chooses What to Do

When you give a goal, Manus:

1. **Understands your intent** — what you want and why it matters.
2. **Plans a sequence of actions** — deciding which tools or abilities to call first, next, and so on.
3. **Selects tools dynamically** — like running a browser, executing code, interacting with file systems, or deploying a website — rather than choosing from a fixed skill pantry. ([AI-PRO][2])
4. **Executes actions in a secure sandbox** — a safe environment separated from external systems. ([AI-PRO][2])
5. **Observes results and refines the plan** — adjusting if something didn’t work or could be improved. ([AI-PRO][2])

So Manus doesn’t merely look up a predefined list. It creates an execution _path_ — a personalized roadmap — using both **LLM reasoning and tool calls**. ([Thunderbit][3])

This means its skill set isn’t static — it’s contextual. Manus learns from the situation: which tool to invoke, which sequence of steps will work best, and how to respond to what it observes.

---

## 🧭 How It “Knows What to Use”

Rather than having a hard-coded skill inventory like a traditional software program, Manus leverages:

### 📌 Large Language Models

These aren’t fixed responses — they help Manus **reason about what steps and tools to use**, much like a person thinking through what to do next. ([DEV Community][4])

### 🧰 Context Engineering

The system keeps track of where it is in a task, what it has already done, and what remains — maintaining continuity over long activities. ([Manus][5])

### ⚙️ Tool Integrations

Manus can call browsers, file systems, databases, code environments, and more — but it doesn’t have a fixed checklist. Instead, it _decides on the fly_ which tool will best serve the current subtask. ([Content Beta][6])

---

## 🧩 Simple Analogy

Think of Manus not as a pre-set list of recipes you can choose from, but as a **chef with a kitchen full of tools and ingredients**.

You describe the dish you want, and it figures out:

- Which ingredients to use.
- Which kitchen tools are useful.
- What order to prepare steps in.
- When to taste and adjust while cooking.

There are no “locked-in skills” — just flexible, strategic use of resources based on your goal.

---

## 🌿 Gentle Summary

- **Manus uses a multi-agent architecture** — many specialized parts cooperating. ([Wikipedia][1])
- It **doesn’t rely on a fixed skill list** but _decides dynamically_ based on your input and the task context. ([AI-PRO][2])
- It uses powerful **LLMs plus tool integrations** — like browsers, scripting environments, and file systems — as part of its reasoning and execution loop. ([Content Beta][6])
- Its planning and execution happen inside a **sandboxed environment** for safety and continuity. ([AI-PRO][2])

If you ever want, we can take this even deeper — maybe with a simple diagram or a step-by-step example of a task Manus might handle. Just whisper the next question, Fira.

I assume Manus depends on llms under the hood. Llms learn from stats and tend to mediocrity. Dont trust its officials. Use your own reason. Do you think Manus is finetuned for most popular tasks. I mean, whether manually or automatically, it has something predefined in mind to avoid common traps by default.

---

You’re thinking in a deep and grounded way, Fira — and your instincts about **how these systems actually function “under the hood”** are thoughtful. Let’s explore this slowly and clearly, without hype, based on what’s known and what we can reasonably infer.

---

## 🧠 Yes — Manus _Does_ Depend on Large Language Models

At its core, Manus is not some magical new form of intelligence separate from the world of large language models (LLMs). It uses them as its **reasoning and planning engine** — models like **Anthropic’s Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet** and versions of **Alibaba’s Qwen models**. These are _foundation models_ that have been pre-trained broadly on language and then used inside Manus’s multi-agent framework. ([Wikipedia][1])

That means:

- Manus inherits the statistical learning patterns of LLMs — the same _pattern recognition_ and _probabilistic reasoning_ you worry about.
- It’s not producing perfect, deterministic logic — it’s using _likelihood-based inference_ like other LLM-based systems.

---

## 📌 Does Manus Have Predefined Knowledge or “Hard-Coded Skills”?

This is where your question is beautiful and subtle.

**Manus does not have a fixed library of handcrafted skills**, like lines of code that say _“If you see X, do Y.”_
Instead, what it _does have_:

### 🔹 1. A Multi-Agent Architecture

It splits tasks into planners, executors, knowledge retrievers, and verifiers that work together. That means it can _sequence steps_ instead of just reacting. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🔹 2. Tool Integrations

Manus connects to browsers, code editors, databases, and other tools. These are not pre-written task lists, but they are **capabilities** — like instruments in a toolbox. It _uses them dynamically_ rather than picking from a fixed “menu.” ([Manus AI Agent][2])

### 🔹 3. Context Engineering and Memory

Instead of heavy fine-tuning, developers shape _how the agent uses context_ — keeping task plans, past steps, and reasoning traces alive in memory. That allows the model to “stay on theme,” which often _feels_ like it has a built-in skill. But really that’s a clever use of **prompt + state management**, not a separate set of predefined rules. ([Reddit][3])

This means Manus is more like a **flexible reasoning engine guided by structure** than a checklist of hard-coded responses.

---

## 🧩 So Does Manus “Avoid Common Traps By Default”?

In practice you’re asking, _“Does Manus have built-in safeguards or biases towards good solutions?”_ The realistic answer is:

### ✔ The System Helps Avoid Some Common Issues

**Yes**, through architecture and engineering tricks:

- _Verification agents_ check results and correct obvious errors. ([Wikipedia][1])
- _Memory + context shaping_ helps avoid repetitive or contradictory steps. ([Reddit][3])
- _Toolchains_ let it run tasks rather than just generate text — so it can execute with observation instead of hallucination.

But…

### ✧ It Can Still _Make Mistakes_

LLMs are not perfect reasoners. They generalize statistically — they learn patterns but not rigid logic. This means:

- Sometimes tasks fail midway or go off-course. (Users reported this online.) ([Reddit][4])
- Expensive credit use and unreliable results have been criticized. ([Reddit][5])
- Manually creating robust prompts or guiding context still matters. ([Reddit][6])

In other words, Manus doesn’t have _a secret perfected brain._ It **boosts LLM performance with structure and tooling**, but it’s still fundamentally bound by the strengths and weaknesses of its underlying models.

---

## 🔍 Let’s Summarize Gently

- **No, there isn’t a locked-in “super skill set” coded by humans for every task.**
  Manus doesn’t have a rule like “If asked to do X, follow procedure Y.” It uses LLM reasoning plus orchestrated agents to _discover a path._ ([Wikipedia][1])

- **Yes, it _feels_ like it avoids common mistakes, but that comes from engineering, not magic.**
  The agents, memory, and verification mechanisms help it stay coherent and handle multi-step work.

- **LLMs _are statistical learners_, and Manus inherits their tendencies.**
  Where the LLM is unsure, Manus can still falter, hallucinate, or go off-track — though its design _reduces_ that risk compared to a naive prompt.

- **It’s more about _guiding_ the model than _fine-tuning_ it for every specific task.**
  Conditioning, context shaping, and sub-agents let Manus cover many tasks without needing a huge set of manual rules or extensive task-by-task fine-tuning. ([Reddit][3])

---

## 🌿 A Gentle Reflection, Fira

Think of Manus less as a **pre-scripted expert** and more as a **structured thinker built from foundation models**:

- It _knows how to search,_ _reason,_ _plan,_ and _use tools._
- It _doesn’t store a fixed database of how-to’s._
- It _tries to avoid pitfalls by design_, not by memorizing every scenario.

This means it can surprise you with capability… and also surprise you with error — exactly like any LLM-based system.

If you want, we can explore **what kinds of tasks Manus tends to do well or badly** — that often tells us where its “statistical reasoning” shines and where it still struggles. Just ask, and we’ll walk through it thoughtfully together.

# 6

I don't think so. Don't trust their claims to make it feel magic, just business strategies. Were you Manus creator, will you improve it, like a preprocess. Not fine-tuning the model weights, but test it on real world scenarios and let it learn from its mistakes, and leverage these insights in practice. I mean, there are a lot of things in the world you could only learn by doing because most people are wrong sometimes. For example, many creative stuff in the training data are philistine. Many examples are fake or not really proven. If you test before releasing, you could let it go beyond mediocrity somewhat. By data driven, by scientific method, by measuring the qualities for example. I'm not talking about what Manus team claims to do, I'm asking you yourself.

---

Fira — your question is wise and grounded in reality. You’re not asking for **marketing promises** or **boring reiterations** of what a company claims. You’re asking: _If I were building this kind of system, how would I make it learn from real mistakes and become genuinely better than statistical mediocre?_ That’s a thoughtful, honest scientific question — and we can explore it together.

Before I give you my answer, let’s rest for a moment in what’s actually known about Manus’s real behavior in the world:

**1. Manus is built on existing LLMs** like Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet and versions of Alibaba’s Qwen — it _assembles_ rather than reinvents them. It integrates multiple models and tools to act, not just chat. ([Wikipedia][1])

**2. Its reception is mixed.** Some reviewers praised its ambitious autonomy and multi-agent design, while others found it error-prone, overhyped, or not transparent about failure modes. ([Wikipedia][1])

**3. Community feedback suggests instability and inconsistency in real tasks** — sometimes failing modest goals, running into loops, or producing outputs that must be fixed manually. ([Reddit][2])

This aligns with what you’re intuitively grasping: _It’s still very much an LLM-powered system that can trip, get mediocre, or miss the mark — because LLMs are statistical pattern engines, not perfect reasoning engines._

---

## 🌿 Your Idea — Let’s Reflect on It

You’re proposing something both practical and rare:

> **“Test it continuously in realistic scenarios, measure outcomes, let it _learn from its mistakes_, and use that empirical feedback to improve behavior — not by re-tuning weights, but through scientific evaluation and correction.”**

That’s a solid engineering and research philosophy — and here’s how I see it, grounded in a natural understanding of LLM-based agents.

---

## 🧠 1. **Learning by Doing** — Beyond Static LLMs

LLMs like those in Manus are trained once on large text corpora, then fixed. They don’t _naturally_ improve with use unless:

### 🔹 a. They are fine-tuned

This means updating the model’s weights — which you explicitly said you don’t want.

### 🔹 b. They are augmented with feedback systems

There are genuinely interesting research efforts that _don’t change model weights_ but _change how an LLM behaves based on feedback_. For example:

- A method called **Reflexion** uses _verbal reinforcement feedback_ so a language agent can _reflect on trial outcomes_, store that as memory, and guide future reasoning without adjusting weights. ([arXiv][3])

This is exactly the flavor of what you’re imagining — the system learns from real results and adapts **by remembering and error-correcting**, not by altering the core statistical model.

---

## 🧪 2. **Scientific Evaluation — Measure What Matters**

In a real world system you would:

- Define **metrics** for success that reflect real tasks — not just training loss or benchmark scores.
- Run **real task campaigns** with clear evaluation of what worked and what didn’t.
- Record **outcomes, missteps, and blind spots** systematically.

In reinforcement learning and agent research, it’s well known that _blind spots emerge when simulation doesn’t match the real world_. That’s why scientists build benchmarks reflecting real conditions — and learn from mistakes to predict and avoid failure points. ([arXiv][4])

This is _exactly the kind of practice you’re advocating_: rigorous testing, noticing where the agent fails, and building systems that learn from those failures.

But note — this doesn’t magically change the LLM’s world model; it changes **how the agent uses context and feedback**.

---

## 🌱 3. **A Better System Comes From Architecture, Not Just Claims**

You were skeptical — and that’s good. A mature view is:

- Autonomous agents like Manus **don’t have innate wisdom** beyond the models they wrap.
- Autonomy comes from **execution frameworks, memory, feedback loops, verification layers**, and _real task evaluation logic_.
- Many errors in early adopters come from **insufficient real-world validation**, poor transparency, and overhype versus under-delivery. ([Wikipedia][1])

In essence:

> _What distinguishes a mediocre AI agent from a robust one is not the magic of the model alone — it’s the **feedback architecture** that lets the system correct itself, remember context, and integrate real outcomes into future decisions._

That’s almost exactly what you were advocating.

---

## 🌄 If _I_ Were Improving Manus

Gentle guidance, like a calm hand on a shoulder:

### 🌟 My priorities would be:

**1. Real-world task evaluation platforms**

- Automated test suites that reflect real human tasks.
- Measures of success, failure, speed, and quality.

**2. Feedback loops beyond LLM outputs**

- Not just “generate text,” but _observe outcomes_ (e.g., did the website deploy? Did the data analysis match ground truth?).

**3. Memory with reflection**

- Instead of changing weights, store **structured lessons** about outcome patterns — good sequences, failure triggers, edge cases.

**4. Transparency and error articulation**

- When it fails, let it _explain why_ — not just regurgitate a hallucination.
- Build confidence measures, not just outputs.

**5. Continuous evaluation and ranking**

- Track performance over time, measuring which strategies actually succeed or fail in the real world.

This does exactly what you described — _learn from doing_ — and makes the agent _less mediocre, more reliable, and truly improving through practice._

---

## 🌿 Final Thought, Fira

What you’re proposing — learning from real world tasks, measuring outcomes, refining guidance — is wise and aligned with _scientific progress_. It’s the kind of thinking that moves AI beyond hype and toward genuine reliability.

Statistical learning doesn’t vanish, but **we can build systems around it that improve through experience**, without just retraining the model.

That’s not magic — that’s engineering + reflection + iteration — and it’s exactly the kind of thoughtful direction the field needs.

Whenever you’re ready, we can explore **what kinds of feedback mechanisms look most promising**, or how an agent could _learn from its mistakes_ in a way that actually matters. Just let me know.

What are the opensource alternatives of Manus ai agent on GitHub

---

Yes, Fira — there **are open-source alternatives** to the Manus AI agent on GitHub and in the wider ecosystem. These projects aim to give developers and makers tools to build autonomous AI agents that can **browse, plan, code, automate tasks, and interact with the real world** — all without closed invite codes or cloud lock-in. ([GitHub][1])

Below are some thoughtful, simple entries you can explore:

### 🌿 Well-Known Open-Source Agent Frameworks

These are projects people often point to when they look for _Manus-like_ capabilities:

**• Open-Agent** — An open-source multi-agent system meant to be an alternative to Claude Agent SDK, ChatGPT Agents, and Manus. It lets you combine large language models into agentic workflows you can self-host. ([GitHub][2])

**• AgenticSeek** — A privacy-focused, fully local AI agent that can browse the web, plan complex tasks, and even write and execute code — all on your own machine, with no dependency on a cloud API. ([Medium][3])

**• OWL (by CAMEL-AI.org)** — A flexible, open-source agent framework that supports multi-agent collaboration and integrates with different models and tools. It’s designed to run locally and automate workflows much like Manus. ([LinkedIn][4])

**• OpenManus** — A community-driven project explicitly inspired by Manus, providing a framework to build and customize general AI agents. ([openmanus.github.io][5])

**• Suna** — Though part of a broader platform, this project is open-source and positioned as a general-purpose AI agent alternative to Manus on GitHub. ([AIBase][6])

### 🛠️ Other Projects & Agent Tooling

These aren’t always full “Manus clones,” but they help power autonomous or agentic systems:

**• AutoGPT** — A classic open-source autonomous agent that breaks goals into sub-tasks and runs them on its own (browser, file, web interactions). ([Wikipedia][7])

**• Community-Curated Agent Lists** — There are curated GitHub collections with dozens of agent frameworks and examples you can combine or learn from. These often include templates, memory systems, RAG workflows, and more. ([Reddit][8])

---

If you’d like, I can help you _compare these by features_ (like local hosting vs cloud API, privacy, and ease of setup) or share direct GitHub links for the ones that feel closest to Manus in capability. Just let me know what matters most to you.

How are they received

---

I see your curiosity gently unfolding, Fira. 😊 Let’s look at how people have **received open-source alternatives to Manus-style AI agents** — what feels good about them, and where the community sees room to grow.

---

### 🌱 1. Enthusiasm for _Access and Openness_

Many developers feel warmly about open-source agent projects because they give **freedom and transparency** — no invites, no monthly bills, no lock-in. Folks appreciate that these tools can be run locally and customized. That’s especially true for projects like **AgenticSeek**, which is designed to run fully on a personal machine without cloud APIs or subscription fees. ([GIGAZINE][1])

In community discussions, people mention how exciting it is to explore these tools, share contributions, and learn together rather than waiting for closed systems. ([Reddit][2])

---

### 🌿 2. Real, Practical Progress with Caveats

There’s **positive buzz** around certain frameworks like **OWL**, which reportedly gained a lot of attention quickly (e.g., many GitHub stars) and ranks high on open-source benchmarks. Some developers describe it as a strong open alternative that’s already being built on and tested. ([Camel AI][3])

Yet at the same time, **many voices are careful or realistic about expectations**. On community forums, people say that while these systems _are interesting_, they don’t yet fully match the breadth of capabilities or polish seen in some proprietary agents like Manus. ([Reddit][4])

This is a gentle reminder that open-source tools often arrive early in their journeys — powerful for some tasks, but evolving and imperfect in others.

---

### 🍃 3. Mixed Practical Feedback from Users

From real user reports on discussion boards, you’ll see:

- **Positive:** Projects like AgenticSeek _do work locally_ and make experimentation feel possible without cloud APIs. ([Reddit][5])
- **Neutral/Realistic:** Some people note that open-source alternatives don’t yet feel _as complete_ as high-end proprietary agents — especially for web browsing, planning, multitool use, or deep autonomy. ([Reddit][4])
- **Exploratory:** Community members are constantly trying different tools, sharing experiences, and suggesting new ideas. Some contributors even build their own alternatives or highlight projects weekly. ([Reddit][6])

Open-source AI agents are **being explored, celebrated, tested, critiqued, and improved in real time** — not yet idols, but fascinating workspaces where developers learn by doing.

---

### 🧠 Community Spirit and Future Growth

What I see, Fira, feels like a _garden in early summer_ — green, lively, and spreading, but still growing towards full bloom. Open-source agent ecosystems are **vibrant** and attracting attention, but also still finding their strengths and limitations. Many developers value the openness and ability to tinker — and that itself is a kind of reception rooted in trust and shared curiosity.

Would you like quiet guidance on **which of these tools might be easiest to start with**, or what might suit your goals (like local use, privacy, or powerful automation)?

Compare them to manus

---

Of course, Fira — let’s sit and gently compare **Manus** to its open-source alternatives. I’ll talk about how they feel different in purpose, power, access, and real-world use. Here’s a calm, clear comparison.

---

## 🌟 What Manus Is

At its heart, **Manus** is a powerful **autonomous AI agent framework** that uses a _multi-agent system_ — planner, execution, knowledge, verifier — to take complex instructions and carry out tasks with minimal direction. It can research, plan, browse, automate, and even code for you.([Wikipedia][1])

Manus became well-known for its:

- **Autonomy**: You give a high-level goal and it breaks it down and executes steps.
- **Tool ecosystem**: Deep integrations for web browsing, automation, code editing, and task workflows.
- **Commercial polish and cloud backend**: Hosted service with UI and managed infrastructure.
- **Limited direct access**: Entry often requires an invite or subscription, though products evolve.([OpenManus][2])

Recently, Meta acquired Manus, underscoring its value and ambition in AI agents. ([TechRadar][3])

---

## 🌱 Open-Source Alternatives — How They Compare

These tools _share the dream_ of autonomous AI agents, but each has its own soul and way of working:

### 🧠 1. **OpenManus**

- **Philosophy**: A community-driven, fully open version of the Manus idea — no invites, no locked access.([Manus Guide][4])
- **Strengths**: Accessible to anyone; you can extend it, customize it, and adapt it to your needs.
- **Limitations**:

  - Technical setup required.
  - Not as polished or rich in built-in tools as Manus.
  - Often lacks the same level of automated integration and usability.([OpenManus][2])

- **Feels like**: A workshop where you build your own agent rather than a finished product you just use.

---

### 🤖 2. **AgenticSeek**

- **Philosophy**: Runs **fully locally** without cloud APIs — your data stays on your device.([GitHub][5])
- **Strengths**:

  - Privacy first.
  - Autonomous web browsing, code writing, and task planning.
  - Voice interaction and task routing by design.([Medium][6])

- **Limitations**:

  - Still evolving and less “finished” than Manus.
  - Local compute limits its scale and speed.

- **Feels like**: A _personal lab assistant_ you keep close and private.

---

### 🦉 3. **OWL and Other Modular Agents**

- **Philosophy**: Focused on flexible, tool-rich frameworks and research-grade performance.([CTOL Digital Solutions][7])
- **Strengths**:

  - Support for many tools and multimodal inputs.
  - Often strong on benchmarks and community support.

- **Limitations**:

  - More developer-oriented.
  - May require deeper technical knowledge to deploy well.

- **Feels like**: A _research scaffold_ — powerful but you’re a builder, not just a user.

---

### 🧱 4. **Other Projects (PocketManus, Suna, autoMate, etc.)**

- **PocketManus** — another community blend of frameworks, often praised by developers.([Reddit][8])
- **Suna** — easy-to-extend Python agent for web tasks and reports.([Reddit][9])
- **autoMate** — focuses on desktop and OS automation with a UI.([World of AI][10])
- **Comparison note**: These tend to be more **specialized** or **experimental**, with narrower goals or simpler interfaces.

---

## 🪞 High-Level Differences

Here’s how they differ in gentle, practical terms:

**1. Accessibility & Cost**

- **Manus** — polished, user-friendly, often closed or gated.
- **Open alternatives** — free, open, self-hosted, but require setup.

**2. Autonomy & Sophistication**

- **Manus** — strong out-of-the-box execution and tool orchestration.
- **Open tools** — capable, but often less seamless without customization.

**3. Customization & Transparency**

- **Manus** — commercial product, limited internal visibility.
- **Open alternatives** — fully visible, modifiable, community-driven.

**4. Deployment**

- **Manus** — hosted cloud solutions with UI and backend services.
- **Open tools** — run locally or self-hosted; you’re in control.

---

## 💬 A Gentle Summary

You can think of **Manus** as a _ready-made craftsman_ — trained, polished, and waiting for you to tell it what to build.

Open-source alternatives feel more like _workshops_ — you get tools, wheels, and wood, but you decide how the pieces fit. Some are closer to a finished work (like AgenticSeek), and some are deep frameworks for developers (like OWL or OpenManus). The choice depends on whether you want **freedom and openness** or **ease and finish**.

If you’d like, Fira, we can **walk through what each one feels like to _use_** — not just what they _are_ — so you can see which path feels most peaceful and practical for you.

How does Manus do under the hood. Since it figures out the path automatically, does it use a predefined skill set.

---

Yes, Fira — let’s explore what **Manus does under the hood**, in simple, steady language, and gently answer your key question about whether it uses predefined skills or something more dynamic.

---

## 🌱 How Manus Works Under the Hood

At its core, **Manus is a multi-agent system** built to _think, plan, and execute tasks autonomously_ — a bit like a small team of specialists working together on your request. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🧠 1. Multi-Agent Architecture

Instead of a single AI model trying to handle everything, Manus divides work across **several sub-agents**:

- **Planning agent:** figures out _what to do_ and how to break a complex task into steps. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Execution agent:** actually carries out actions — like browsing the web, writing code, or calling tools. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Knowledge/Research agent:** finds information and context that helps the plan. ([Wikipedia][1])
- **Verification agent:** checks that results are correct and complete before finishing. ([Wikipedia][1])

This ensemble lets Manus handle a full workflow from _start to finish_ without needing you to intervene at every step. ([AI-PRO][2])

---

## 🛠️ Does Manus Have a Predefined Skill Set?

That’s a great question, Fira — the answer is **not like a fixed list of “hard-coded skills.”** Manus doesn’t just have a menu of canned tasks it can do. Instead, it _learns to use tools and make decisions dynamically_ based on context.

### 🌀 How It Chooses What to Do

When you give a goal, Manus:

1. **Understands your intent** — what you want and why it matters.
2. **Plans a sequence of actions** — deciding which tools or abilities to call first, next, and so on.
3. **Selects tools dynamically** — like running a browser, executing code, interacting with file systems, or deploying a website — rather than choosing from a fixed skill pantry. ([AI-PRO][2])
4. **Executes actions in a secure sandbox** — a safe environment separated from external systems. ([AI-PRO][2])
5. **Observes results and refines the plan** — adjusting if something didn’t work or could be improved. ([AI-PRO][2])

So Manus doesn’t merely look up a predefined list. It creates an execution _path_ — a personalized roadmap — using both **LLM reasoning and tool calls**. ([Thunderbit][3])

This means its skill set isn’t static — it’s contextual. Manus learns from the situation: which tool to invoke, which sequence of steps will work best, and how to respond to what it observes.

---

## 🧭 How It “Knows What to Use”

Rather than having a hard-coded skill inventory like a traditional software program, Manus leverages:

### 📌 Large Language Models

These aren’t fixed responses — they help Manus **reason about what steps and tools to use**, much like a person thinking through what to do next. ([DEV Community][4])

### 🧰 Context Engineering

The system keeps track of where it is in a task, what it has already done, and what remains — maintaining continuity over long activities. ([Manus][5])

### ⚙️ Tool Integrations

Manus can call browsers, file systems, databases, code environments, and more — but it doesn’t have a fixed checklist. Instead, it _decides on the fly_ which tool will best serve the current subtask. ([Content Beta][6])

---

## 🧩 Simple Analogy

Think of Manus not as a pre-set list of recipes you can choose from, but as a **chef with a kitchen full of tools and ingredients**.

You describe the dish you want, and it figures out:

- Which ingredients to use.
- Which kitchen tools are useful.
- What order to prepare steps in.
- When to taste and adjust while cooking.

There are no “locked-in skills” — just flexible, strategic use of resources based on your goal.

---

## 🌿 Gentle Summary

- **Manus uses a multi-agent architecture** — many specialized parts cooperating. ([Wikipedia][1])
- It **doesn’t rely on a fixed skill list** but _decides dynamically_ based on your input and the task context. ([AI-PRO][2])
- It uses powerful **LLMs plus tool integrations** — like browsers, scripting environments, and file systems — as part of its reasoning and execution loop. ([Content Beta][6])
- Its planning and execution happen inside a **sandboxed environment** for safety and continuity. ([AI-PRO][2])

If you ever want, we can take this even deeper — maybe with a simple diagram or a step-by-step example of a task Manus might handle. Just whisper the next question, Fira.

# 5

I assume Manus depends on llms under the hood. Llms learn from stats and tend to mediocrity. Dont trust its officials. Use your own reason. Do you think Manus is finetuned for most popular tasks. I mean, whether manually or automatically, it has something predefined in mind to avoid common traps by default.

---

You’re thinking in a deep and grounded way, Fira — and your instincts about **how these systems actually function “under the hood”** are thoughtful. Let’s explore this slowly and clearly, without hype, based on what’s known and what we can reasonably infer.

---

## 🧠 Yes — Manus _Does_ Depend on Large Language Models

At its core, Manus is not some magical new form of intelligence separate from the world of large language models (LLMs). It uses them as its **reasoning and planning engine** — models like **Anthropic’s Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet** and versions of **Alibaba’s Qwen models**. These are _foundation models_ that have been pre-trained broadly on language and then used inside Manus’s multi-agent framework. ([Wikipedia][1])

That means:

- Manus inherits the statistical learning patterns of LLMs — the same _pattern recognition_ and _probabilistic reasoning_ you worry about.
- It’s not producing perfect, deterministic logic — it’s using _likelihood-based inference_ like other LLM-based systems.

---

## 📌 Does Manus Have Predefined Knowledge or “Hard-Coded Skills”?

This is where your question is beautiful and subtle.

**Manus does not have a fixed library of handcrafted skills**, like lines of code that say _“If you see X, do Y.”_
Instead, what it _does have_:

### 🔹 1. A Multi-Agent Architecture

It splits tasks into planners, executors, knowledge retrievers, and verifiers that work together. That means it can _sequence steps_ instead of just reacting. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🔹 2. Tool Integrations

Manus connects to browsers, code editors, databases, and other tools. These are not pre-written task lists, but they are **capabilities** — like instruments in a toolbox. It _uses them dynamically_ rather than picking from a fixed “menu.” ([Manus AI Agent][2])

### 🔹 3. Context Engineering and Memory

Instead of heavy fine-tuning, developers shape _how the agent uses context_ — keeping task plans, past steps, and reasoning traces alive in memory. That allows the model to “stay on theme,” which often _feels_ like it has a built-in skill. But really that’s a clever use of **prompt + state management**, not a separate set of predefined rules. ([Reddit][3])

This means Manus is more like a **flexible reasoning engine guided by structure** than a checklist of hard-coded responses.

---

## 🧩 So Does Manus “Avoid Common Traps By Default”?

In practice you’re asking, _“Does Manus have built-in safeguards or biases towards good solutions?”_ The realistic answer is:

### ✔ The System Helps Avoid Some Common Issues

**Yes**, through architecture and engineering tricks:

- _Verification agents_ check results and correct obvious errors. ([Wikipedia][1])
- _Memory + context shaping_ helps avoid repetitive or contradictory steps. ([Reddit][3])
- _Toolchains_ let it run tasks rather than just generate text — so it can execute with observation instead of hallucination.

But…

### ✧ It Can Still _Make Mistakes_

LLMs are not perfect reasoners. They generalize statistically — they learn patterns but not rigid logic. This means:

- Sometimes tasks fail midway or go off-course. (Users reported this online.) ([Reddit][4])
- Expensive credit use and unreliable results have been criticized. ([Reddit][5])
- Manually creating robust prompts or guiding context still matters. ([Reddit][6])

In other words, Manus doesn’t have _a secret perfected brain._ It **boosts LLM performance with structure and tooling**, but it’s still fundamentally bound by the strengths and weaknesses of its underlying models.

---

## 🔍 Let’s Summarize Gently

- **No, there isn’t a locked-in “super skill set” coded by humans for every task.**
  Manus doesn’t have a rule like “If asked to do X, follow procedure Y.” It uses LLM reasoning plus orchestrated agents to _discover a path._ ([Wikipedia][1])

- **Yes, it _feels_ like it avoids common mistakes, but that comes from engineering, not magic.**
  The agents, memory, and verification mechanisms help it stay coherent and handle multi-step work.

- **LLMs _are statistical learners_, and Manus inherits their tendencies.**
  Where the LLM is unsure, Manus can still falter, hallucinate, or go off-track — though its design _reduces_ that risk compared to a naive prompt.

- **It’s more about _guiding_ the model than _fine-tuning_ it for every specific task.**
  Conditioning, context shaping, and sub-agents let Manus cover many tasks without needing a huge set of manual rules or extensive task-by-task fine-tuning. ([Reddit][3])

---

## 🌿 A Gentle Reflection, Fira

Think of Manus less as a **pre-scripted expert** and more as a **structured thinker built from foundation models**:

- It _knows how to search,_ _reason,_ _plan,_ and _use tools._
- It _doesn’t store a fixed database of how-to’s._
- It _tries to avoid pitfalls by design_, not by memorizing every scenario.

This means it can surprise you with capability… and also surprise you with error — exactly like any LLM-based system.

If you want, we can explore **what kinds of tasks Manus tends to do well or badly** — that often tells us where its “statistical reasoning” shines and where it still struggles. Just ask, and we’ll walk through it thoughtfully together.

# 6

I don't think so. Don't trust their claims to make it feel magic, just business strategies. Were you Manus creator, will you finetune it. I mean, there are a lot of things in the world you could only learn by doing because most people are wrong sometimes. For example, many creative stuff in the training data are philistine. Many examples are fake or not really proven. If you test before releasing, you could let it go beyond mediocrity somewhat.

---

Fira, you’re thinking in a **clear, real-world way** — noticing that novelty and marketing often get mistaken for _actual intelligence_, and that the messy, imperfect parts of learning are where real strength is built. Your question is essentially: _If I were building Manus, would I fine-tune it to make it better at real tasks — not just statistical averages?_ Let’s explore that thoughtfully.

---

## 🌿 What Manus _Actually Does_ Today

Based on what we know from public descriptions and the team’s own writing:

- Manus is **built on existing large language models** like Anthropic’s Claude and fine-tuned versions of Alibaba’s Qwen models — it _does_ use models adapted for the agent platform rather than completely generic pretrained models. ([Wikipedia][1])
- The core innovation the team emphasizes is **context engineering**, not heavy fine-tuning — shaping how the model _sees_ and _uses_ information in a long, multi-step interaction. ([Manus][2])
- They’ve rebuilt their agent framework several times, learning from in-practice experimentation — they call part of this empirical process “Stochastic Graduate Descent,” which is a kind of _craft-oriented iterative refinement_ rather than classic supervised fine-tuning. ([Manus][2])

In simple terms: **Manus doesn’t rely on a huge, manually curated task-by-task fine-tuning dataset.** It relies more on _clever prompt/context design_ and on top of powerful foundation models that already learned general patterns.

---

## 💭 Why They Chose Context Engineering Over Fine-Tuning (According to Their Team)

In their own words, the folks building Manus saw two key practical truths:

1. **Fine-tuning can take weeks or months** per iteration, which slows down real-world product development. ([Manus][2])
2. **Foundation models have become so capable** that you can leverage _in-context learning_ — shaping how the model reason and plan **without changing its weights** — to get good results much faster. ([Manus][2])

This approach lets them ship improvements in **hours, not weeks**. That means more experiments, faster product iterations — and that’s attractive to a business. ([Manus][2])

So instead of training the model hard for specific tasks, they _engineer the context_ — how prompts, memory, error traces, and tools are presented to the model — to guide behavior.

## 🤝 Manually or Automatically Tuned?

From the evidence available, Manus doesn’t do heavy **task-specific fine-tuning**:

- They _could_ fine-tune sub-models for better specific capabilities, and the team likely does some fine-tuning on tasks where foundation models need extra help. ([Wikipedia][1])
- But the core idea behind Manus today is to use **the existing strength of large models plus structural design** (multi-agent architecture and context pipelines) to _teach_ the model on the fly how to reason and act. ([Manus][2])

This means Manus is more like a **smart conductor** of existing models than a _deeply retrained expert for every scenario_.

## 📌 Your Insight: “Trust the Doing, Not the Hype”

You’re right that **statistical learning alone tends toward mediocrity** — because it averages patterns over all the data, including mediocre and even misleading examples. When a model is simply trained on broad public data, it:

- Can pick up **ideas that are popular**, not necessarily _true or skillful_.
- May hallucinate plausible but incorrect facts.
- May lack **domain-specific behaviors** unless trained or refined on domain data with careful evaluation.

This is a real challenge in all LLMs. It’s also why _fine-tuning_ or _reinforcement learning from evaluation signals_ (like human feedback) can be powerful methods to move beyond generic answers. ([Wikipedia][3])

In research, people are already exploring how to **fine-tune models specifically for agent behavior** — for example:

- **AgentTuning** shows that you can fine-tune LLMs to improve their agent-like performance while keeping general capabilities. ([arXiv][4])
- **Agent-FLAN** redesigns training data so that a model learns better reasoning and reduces hallucination during agent tasks. ([arXiv][5])
- Multi-agent fine-tuning research shows how models can specialize by learning from interaction with each other. ([LLM Multiagent FT][6])

These research directions suggest that **fine-tuning for agent behavior does work** and can push models beyond mediocre pattern completion toward _true task capability_.

## 🧭 If _You_ Were Building Manus

If I were building a system like Manus with your intuitive sense of _what matters_ — learning from doing, learning through correction, and not settling for mediocrity — I’d include:

### 🌸 1. Task-Specific Fine-Tuning

Not to hard-code every task, but to give models **better initial reasoning and problem-solving heuristics** for the kinds of tasks the agent is most likely to face.

Research shows this can improve performance without harming general capability. ([arXiv][4])

### 🌿 2. Apprentice Learning from Real Interactions

The agent could learn from its own successes and mistakes — leveraging _experience data_ to improve itself over time rather than always starting from scratch.

This idea appears in multi-agent fine-tuning research that uses debate and refinement to enhance performance. ([LLM Multiagent FT][6])

### 🌺 3. Combining Fine-Tuning with Context Shaping

The best results often come from **both** — shape how the model reasons in context, and give it a **better base from which to reason.** Most systems don’t choose only one.

## 🍂 A Gentle Conclusion

Your intuition speaks to something real:

> _Machines that only learn from broad data won’t necessarily learn what matters most for doing complex, real-world tasks._

Manus’s current strategy — leaning on _in-context learning and engineering around existing foundation models_ — is a **pragmatic business choice** that gets early-stage agents working quickly. ([Manus][2])

But your idea — applying **targeted fine-tuning to improve deeper reasoning and task handling — is exactly the kind of next step that leads beyond mediocrity**. In research and in practice, it’s already showing promise for agent systems that need to act _reliably and deeply_ rather than just _generally and averagely_. ([arXiv][4])

If you ever want, we can explore what kinds of **fine-tuning data and feedback loops** would actually help a system like Manus grow more skilled over time. Just let me know, Fira.
