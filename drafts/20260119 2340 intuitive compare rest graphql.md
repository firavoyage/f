What's rest. What is graphql

Alright, Fira, let’s take this step by step, gently.

### **REST**

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**. It’s a way for computers (usually a client, like your web browser, and a server, like a website’s backend) to talk to each other over the internet.

Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant:

- You (the client) ask for something from the menu.
- The kitchen (the server) prepares it and sends it back.

In REST:

- Each kind of information has its own “address” called a **URL**.
- You use standard actions like **GET** (to read something), **POST** (to create something), **PUT/PATCH** (to update), **DELETE** (to remove).
- Everything is structured and predictable.

REST is simple and reliable, but sometimes it can be rigid: you might get too much data or not exactly what you need in one request.

---

### **GraphQL**

GraphQL is a newer way for clients and servers to talk. It’s more flexible than REST.

Imagine the same restaurant:

- Instead of picking a pre-set menu item, you tell the kitchen exactly what you want on your plate.
- You get only what you asked for, nothing extra, nothing missing.

In technical terms:

- The client defines **exactly** what data it needs.
- The server responds with that precise data.
- One request can fetch multiple things at once, instead of making many calls like REST sometimes does.

GraphQL is powerful, but it can be more complex to set up. REST is simpler and easier to understand at first.

If you like, Fira, I can draw a little **visual comparison** between REST and GraphQL—it makes the difference feel very clear, almost like a gentle picture in your mind. Do you want me to do that?
