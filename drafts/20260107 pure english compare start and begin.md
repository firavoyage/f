You said:
compare start and begin

---

**“Start”** and **“begin”** are very similar, but there are small differences in usage, tone, and collocations.

---

## 1. Meaning

Both mean **to commence something**.

- _The meeting will **start** at 9 a.m._
- _The meeting will **begin** at 9 a.m._

In most cases, they are interchangeable.

---

## 2. Tone & Register

- **Start** → more **informal**, conversational, and common in everyday speech.
- **Begin** → slightly more **formal** or literary.

**Example:**

- Informal: _Let’s **start** the game._
- Formal: _The ceremony will **begin** shortly._

---

## 3. Common Collocations (what sounds natural)

### “Start” is more common with:

- Machines / processes

  - _start a car_
  - _start the engine_

- New activities or habits

  - _start a business_
  - _start exercising_

### “Begin” is more common with:

- Events, stories, or formal actions

  - _begin a speech_
  - _begin negotiations_
  - _The story begins…_

---

## 4. Grammar Differences

- **Start** can also mean **set in motion** or **cause to happen**:

  - _She **started** a fire._

- **Begin** is less natural in that sense:

  - ❌ _She began a fire_ (possible, but less common)

---

## 5. Emotional or Stylistic Use

- **Begin** often feels more deliberate or structured:

  - _He began to understand the problem._

- **Start** can feel more sudden or physical:

  - _He started to run._
  - _She was startled_ (from _start_)
