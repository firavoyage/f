# a

could every question word be replace by what

---

That's an interesting question! While **"what" is the most versatile question word**, it cannot **fully and accurately** replace every other question word in English. Here’s a breakdown:

### **When "What" Can Act as a Substitute (but often less precisely)**

1.  **For "Which"** (when choosing from an implied set):

    - Original: _"Which car is yours?"_
    - With "What": _"What car is yours?"_ (This works colloquially, but "which" is better for specific choices.)

2.  **For "Why"** (in the specific phrase "What for?"):

    - Original: _"Why did you do that?"_
    - With "What": _"What did you do that for?"_ (Means the same, but is more informal.)

3.  **For "How"** (in limited cases about descriptions):
    - Original: _"How is the weather?"_ (Asking for a description)
    - With "What": _"What is the weather like?"_ (Means the same thing.)

---

### **When "What" Fails or Changes the Meaning**

This is where the essential meaning is lost:

1.  **Who** (asks about a person's identity or role):

    - _"Who is your teacher?"_ → Asking for a **person** (Ms. Smith).
    - _"What is your teacher?"_ → Sounds like you're asking for a **job title or species** (a human? a dolphin?).

2.  **Where** (asks about location):

    - _"Where do you live?"_ → Asking for a **place** (Paris).
    - _"What do you live?"_ → This is grammatically incorrect and meaningless.

3.  **When** (asks about time):

    - _"When is the meeting?"_ → Asking for a **time** (3 PM).
    - _"What is the meeting?"_ → Asking for the **purpose or nature** of the meeting.

4.  **Why** (asks about reason or cause):

    - _"Why is the sky blue?"_ → Asking for a **scientific explanation**.
    - _"What is the sky blue?"_ → Nonsensical.

5.  **How** (asks about manner, condition, or degree):

    - _"How did you fix it?"_ → Asking for the **method** (with a wrench).
    - _"What did you fix it?"_ → Incorrect.
    - _"How are you?"_ → Asking about **state/condition** (good, tired).
    - _"What are you?"_ → Asking for your **identity/job/nature**.

6.  **Whose** (asks about possession):
    - _"Whose book is this?"_ → Asking for the **owner** (Sarah's).
    - _"What book is this?"_ → Asking for the **title or topic** (_War and Peace_).

### **Conclusion**

You **cannot** universally replace all question words with "what." While "what" is flexible for things, ideas, actions, and descriptions, the other question words (**who, where, when, why, how, whose**) carry **specific semantic content** (person, place, time, reason, manner, possession) that "what" does not.

Using "what" in their place would often result in **grammatical errors, nonsense questions, or a significant change in meaning.** Language uses these distinct words for **clarity and precision.**

# b

could every question word be replace by what somehow

---

That's an interesting question! The short answer is **no, not directly or naturally**, but **you can often rephrase a question using "what" to get a similar answer, usually by making the question more vague or awkward.**

The key is that each question word (_who, where, when, why, how, which_) has a specific semantic job. Replacing them with "what" strips away that specific meaning and forces the listener to infer it from context.

Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Who → What** (Sometimes, but dehumanizes)

- **"Who is that?"** (Asking for a person's identity).
- **Forced replacement:** **"What is that?"** (This now sounds like you're pointing at an object, not a person. It can be rude).
- **Rephrase with "what":** **"What person is that?"** or **"What is that person's name?"** (This works, but "who" is far more natural and respectful).

### 2. **Where → What** (Only through rephrasing)

- **"Where is the bank?"** (Asking for a location).
- **Forced replacement:** **"What is the bank?"** (This now asks for a definition, not a location).
- **Rephrase with "what":** **"What is the location of the bank?"** (This works grammatically but is clunky).

### 3. **When → What** (Often works with "time")

- **"When does the meeting start?"**
- **Natural rephrase with "what":** **"What time does the meeting start?"** (Excellent and common).
- For dates: **"What is the date of the meeting?"** (Works, but "when" is simpler).

### 4. **Why → What** (Requires significant rephrasing)

- **"Why are you late?"** (Asking for a reason).
- **Forced replacement:** **"What are you late?"** (Nonsense).
- **Rephrase with "what":** **"What is the reason for your lateness?"** or **"What caused you to be late?"** (These work but are formal/indirect).

### 5. **How → What** (Often works with "way" or "method")

- **"How did you fix it?"** (Asking for method or manner).
- **Rephrase with "what":** **"What method did you use to fix it?"** or **"What was the way you fixed it?"** (These work).
- **"How are you?"** → **"What is your condition?"** (Very awkward and clinical).

### 6. **Which → What** (Often interchangeable for things, less so for people)

- **"Which color do you prefer, red or blue?"** (Implies a limited set).
- **"What color do you prefer?"** (More open-ended, but often used interchangeably in casual speech).
- For people: **"Which of your brothers is here?"** vs. **"What brother is here?"** (The latter sounds odd).

### The Linguistic Reason

- **"What" is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun for _things_, concepts, actions, and definitions.** Its domain is objects and ideas.
- **The other words are semantically specific:**
  - **Who** = persons
  - **Where** = place
  - **When** = time
  - **Why** = reason/cause
  - **How** = manner/method/condition
  - **Which** = choice from a known set

When you replace them with "what," you lose that immediate specificity. The listener must recover the meaning from the rest of the sentence or context.

### Conclusion

You cannot **directly substitute** "what" for every question word and have a grammatical or meaningful sentence. However, you can often **circumlocute** (rephrase using more words) a question that starts with another interrogative into a longer question that uses "what" + a noun (like _reason_, _time_, _place_, _method_, _person_).

So, while "what" is a versatile tool, English relies on its full suite of question words for **clarity, efficiency, and naturalness**.

# c

could every question word be replace with what and a few more words somehow

---

That's a fascinating question, and the answer is **yes, in theory, but it would sound very awkward and inefficient.**

You can almost always rephrase a question using "what" plus a preposition or a descriptive phrase to _approximate_ the meaning of other question words. However, you lose the **specificity, conciseness, and natural flow** of the original.

Here’s a breakdown of how each question word could be replaced:

### 1. **Who** → **What person / people**

- **Original:** _Who is at the door?_
- **Rephrased:** **\*What person** is at the door?\*
- **Why it's awkward:** "Who" is direct and natural. "What person" is clunky.

### 2. **Where** → **What place / location**

- **Original:** _Where did you go?_
- **Rephrased:** **\*What place** did you go to?\*
- **Why it's awkward:** It's wordy. "Where" is a clean, one-word concept for location.

### 3. **When** → **What time / day / date**

- **Original:** _When is the meeting?_
- **Rephrased:** **\*What time** is the meeting?\* (less general)
- **Rephrased:** **\*What day and time** is the meeting?\*
- **Why it's awkward:** "When" is beautifully ambiguous (could be time, date, century). The "what" replacement forces you to be more specific than you might intend.

### 4. **Why** → **For what reason / purpose**

- **Original:** _Why did she leave?_
- **Rephrased:** **\*For what reason** did she leave?\*
- **Why it's awkward:** "Why" is immediate and focuses on cause. "For what reason" is formal and wordy.

### 5. **How** → **In what way / manner / By what means**

- **Original:** _How did you fix it?_
- **Rephrased:** **\*In what way** did you fix it?\* (method)
- **Rephrased:** **\*By what means** did you fix it?\* (tools)
- **Original:** _How are you feeling?_
- **Rephrased:** **\*In what state** are you feeling?\* (very awkward!)
- **Why it's awkward:** "How" is incredibly versatile (method, condition, degree). Replacing it often requires guessing which meaning of "how" is being used.

### 6. **Which** → **What one / ones (from a known set)**

- **Original:** _Which car is yours?_ (pointing to a parking lot)
- **Rephrased:** **\*What one** of these cars is yours?\*
- **Why it's awkward:** "Which" inherently implies a limited choice. "What" is more open-ended, so you have to add words ("of these") to recreate that limitation.

### 7. **Whose** → **Of what person / people**

- **Original:** _Whose book is this?_
- **Rephrased:** **\*Of what person** is this book?\*
- **Why it's awkward:** It sounds archaic or like legalese. "Whose" is simple and clear.

### 8. **How much / How many** → **What amount / What number**

- **Original:** _How much sugar?_ / _How many apples?_
- **Rephrased:** **\*What amount** of sugar?\* / **\*What number** of apples?\*
- **Why it's awkward:** It's unnecessarily formal and technical.

### **Why We Don't Actually Do This:**

1.  **Efficiency:** Language evolves to be efficient. "Where" is a one-word, high-concept tool. Replacing it with "what place" adds syllables and cognitive load.
2.  **Specificity:** Each question word targets a specific domain (time, reason, person). Using "what" for everything makes questions vaguer initially, until the extra words clarify it.
3.  **Grammar & Flow:** The rephrased versions often require changing the sentence structure (adding prepositions like _for, in, of_), making it less fluid.
4.  **Idiomatic Use:** Questions like "How are you?" or "What's up?" are fixed social formulas. Replacing "How" in "How are you?" sounds strange and clinical.

### **The Philosophical Take**

You've essentially pointed out that **"what" is the fundamental, content-based question word.** It asks for a _thing_ or a _description_. The other question words are **specialized tools** that categorize the expected answer _before_ it's even given:

- "Who" → expects a **person** as the answer.
- "Where" → expects a **location**.
- "Why" → expects a **reason**.

So, while you can _describe_ the category using "what" and more words, it's much more elegant to _specify_ the category using a dedicated word.

**Conclusion:** Yes, it's structurally possible, but it would make English sound like a clumsy translation. The other question words exist for a very good reason: they make communication precise and efficient.
