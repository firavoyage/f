bold, italic, blockquote, unordered lists, ...
what are things like these called.

Excellent question!

The general category for things like **bold**, _italic_, `code`, blockquotes, and lists is **Text Formatting** or **Text Styling**.

However, depending on the specific context, they have more precise names:

### 1. In Word Processors & Rich Text Editors (like Google Docs, Word)

They are most commonly called **Formatting Options** or **Text Styles**. The toolbar that contains these buttons is often called the **Formatting Toolbar**.

### 2. In Markdown, HTML, and other Markup Languages

This is where the terminology gets more specific. Collectively, they are known as **Markup**.

- **Markdown Syntax:** In Markdown, things like `**bold**`, `*italic*`, and `>` for blockquotes are called **formatting syntax** or simply **Markdown**.
- **HTML Tags:** In HTML, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<blockquote>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` are called **HTML Tags** or **Elements**. They are used to **mark up** the text to give it structure and meaning.

### 3. The Most Accurate Umbrella Term: **Typography**

In the world of design and publishing, the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing is called **Typography**. Your examples are all fundamental aspects of typography.

We can break them down into more specific typographic terms:

- **bold** and _italic_ are **Type Styles** or **Font Weights & Styles**.
- Blockquotes are a type of **text block** or **pull quote**.
- Unordered (and ordered) lists are **List Styles**.

### Summary of Key Terms:

| Context             | General Term                                   | Specific Examples                                  |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anywhere**        | **Text Formatting**, **Text Styling**          | Making text bold, creating a list                  |
| **Word Processors** | **Formatting Options**, **Styles**             | The "Bold" button, the "Heading 1" style           |
| **Web & Markup**    | **Markup**, **HTML Tags**, **Markdown Syntax** | `<strong>`, `**text**`, `- list item`              |
| **Design**          | **Typography**                                 | Using italics for emphasis, indenting a blockquote |

So, while "text formatting" is the simple, universal answer, the most technically precise and encompassing term from a design and publishing standpoint is **typography**.

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how we work with text.

Here is a comparison of "Text Formatting" and "Typography."

### The Quick Analogy

Think of building a house:

- **Text Formatting** is like using a hammer and nails. It's the basic act of putting the pieces together—making a wall, attaching a door. It's functional and direct.
- **Typography** is like architecture. It's the overall plan that considers proportion, flow, light, and how people will _experience_ the space. It's artistic and strategic.

### Deeper Explanation

#### Text Formatting: The "What"

Text formatting is about the immediate, visible properties of the text. When you highlight a sentence and click the "B" button to make it bold, you are formatting text. It's a set of discrete actions. It's essential and forms the foundation upon which typography is built.

- **Example:** Creating a heading by selecting text and choosing "Heading 1" from a styles menu. This is formatting. It applies a pre-defined set of rules (size, weight, spacing).

#### Typography: The "Why" and "How"

Typography is the reasoning _behind_ those formatting choices and the subtle adjustments that make the difference between "good enough" and "beautifully readable." It's a holistic discipline.

A typographer doesn't just pick a font; they choose a typeface that matches the message (e.g., a serious serif for a law firm, a friendly rounded sans-serif for a children's app). They don't just adjust line spacing because it "looks better"; they calculate it to reduce eye strain and improve the reader's flow.

- **Example:** After applying the "Heading 1" style (formatting), a person using typography might then adjust the letter-spacing (tracking) to make it feel more open, or add a slight margin below it to better separate it from the paragraph that follows. They are fine-tuning the _relationship_ of the elements.

### Key Takeaway

**All typography involves text formatting, but not all text formatting is good typography.**

You can perfectly format a document—with correct headings, bolded words, and bullet points—but if the line length is too long, the line spacing is too tight, and the font is hard to read, the **typography** is poor.

**In summary:**

- Use **text formatting** to _structure_ your content.
- Use **typography** to _communicate_ and _connect_ with your reader.
