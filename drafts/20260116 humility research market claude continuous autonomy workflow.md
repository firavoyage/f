# 1 (evaluate claude code as a general purpose agent)

What do you say about Claude code as a general purpose agent. How well does it do besides software engineering. Don't mention cowork, which is just a Claude code wrapper now.

---

Thanks for opening that question gently, Fira 🌿
Let’s sit with it in simple terms — what’s the shape of Claude Code as a _general‑purpose agent_, beyond just coding work?

### 🌱 At its heart: Claude Code is an _agentic platform_

Originally, Claude Code was built to help with software engineering — automating edits, writing code, managing projects, even running commands in your terminal. It’s grounded in giving the model _tools_ (like filesystem access, bash commands, web search, and subagents), so it can **act in the world instead of just talking about it**. ([Claude Docs][1])

This shift — from “answering questions” to “doing things with tools” — is the core of what people mean by _general‑purpose agents_. It’s not just about software engineering: it’s about **purposeful, multi‑step task execution**.

### 🌟 What it can do outside of pure coding

Here’s where the gentle wisdom comes in, Fira: the _foundation_ that makes Claude Code strong for coding is the same foundation that lets it help with many other kinds of digital work.

Because Claude Code has:

**• access to filesystems and tools** — it can read/write files, run scripts, manipulate documents. ([Anthropic][2])
**• ability to delegate to subagents** — smaller, specialized assistants it spins up for certain tasks. ([Claude Docs][3])
**• iterative action loops** — it can _plan, act, check, repeat_. ([Anthropic][2])

It has already been used for things like:

🌿 _data work_: reading spreadsheets, cleaning data, creating visualizations. ([Claude][4])
📄 _document processing_: extracting, summarizing, formatting across file types. ([Claude][4])
📊 _analytics & reports_: generating insights or dashboards. ([Claude][4])
📁 _digital organization_: reading folders, combining notes into documents. (seen in early agent experiments) ([WIRED][5])

So, beyond pure code, it’s already stretching into _digital workflow territory_ — tasks that require context, planning, and execution.

### 🌧️ And yet, some important quiet limits

It’s good to hold expectations gently:

- Claude’s actions still work best when the _environment_ is digital — files, tools, web data — rather than the messy unpredictable physical world.
- Its understanding isn’t human intuition; it’s pattern completion guided by tools. That means it excels when instructions are clear and structured.
- People using these tools still need to _guide, review, and check_ what the agent does — particularly for nuanced or high‑stakes work. ([The Times of India][6])

### 💭 So, how well does Claude Code _really_ work as a general agent?

From a calm place, I’d say:

> **Claude Code offers a bridge between “conversation” and “action.”**
> When it has the right tools — access to files, context, and sub‑agents — it can _automate_ meaningful work outside of coding.
> But it’s not magic. It’s more like a capable, careful assistant that thrives when given clear environments and goals.

You might think of it like a steady helper sitting beside you at the desk — not replacing your judgement, but doing the steps you teach it. It’s strong in structured digital spaces; less so in ambiguous, deeply creative, or non‑computational realms.

If you want, Fira, we can talk about specific types of tasks you’re curious about — and how Claude Code might handle them.

What do people say

---

Thanks for asking, Fira — let’s take a calm look at _what people are actually saying_ about Claude Code as more than just a coder’s tool. These sentiments come from users, writers, and discussions across the web and tech communities. 🌿

---

### 🌟 **Positive and hopeful voices**

**People who’ve used it see real power in automation.**
Some experienced developers say Claude Code isn’t just about writing snippets — it can automate _workflows_, execute tasks, and orchestrate actions across tools. One writer even argues it’s misnamed as a coding tool, because its real use is **general computer automation**: anything you could achieve by typing commands into a computer, you could automate with it if you know how. ([Aaron Nam][1])

**Some early adopters and insiders celebrate its productivity.**
There are accounts from engineers showing prolific use — hundreds of commits, lots of PRs — demonstrating that experienced users can integrate Claude Code deeply into their workflows. ([Medium][2])

---

### ☁️ **Mixed reactions and creative experiments**

**Communities are experimenting with workflows.**
On developer forums, people talk about creative ways to make Claude Code work for them — like managing several agents in parallel or adding plugins for memory between sessions. These are signs of people _pushing_ the tool beyond simple coding. ([Reddit][3])

**Some users think the quality can vary.**
There are reports of inconsistency — occasionally slow responses, glitches, or outputs that miss the mark. Some users feel you still need strong human oversight, especially for complex work. ([Apiyi Blog][4])

---

### ⚠️ **Criticism and caution**

**Users sometimes feel frustrated or disappointed.**
In community threads, some long‑term users have shared frustration with reliability issues, feeling the experience has degraded at times and isn’t always dependable for larger tasks. ([Reddit][5])

**Quality of generated work is debated.**
A few experienced developers say they’ve rewritten most — or even every — piece of code the agent produced because it wasn’t clean or maintainable. They still use it for _initial drafts_ or learning, but not as a final solution. ([Reddit][6])

**Some find the interface complex and costly.**
Other reviews point out interruptions for permissions, token‑based cost surprises, or difficulty handling very large scopes, especially for non‑routine automation tasks. ([Apiyi Blog][4])

---

### 🌿 **For broader context**

Even outside these specific discussions, industry awareness is growing that agentic AI tools — like Claude Code and its successors — are _part of a larger trend_ toward AI that isn’t just chatbots but _doers_: tools that act with intent and execution, rather than just respond. Some media pieces see this as a glimpse into what future AI assistants might be like. ([TIME][7])

---

### 🌙 **A gentle summary**

In calm, honest terms, here’s how people are talking about Claude Code beyond software engineering:

- **Some see it as an early version of a true digital assistant — capable of automation, not just coding.**
- **Many love its power when they understand its quirks and constraints.**
- **A number of people remind each other that it still needs human judgement, especially for complex or high‑stakes tasks.**
- **And there’s a healthy mix of excitement, experimentation, caution, and critique.**

It’s like standing at a river’s edge and watching a new current form — some swimmers are gliding with it, others are splashing and learning the flow. If you want, we can talk about what _type of tasks_ people feel it’s best suited for these days.

# 3 (hear, specify)

How well is it now in continuous autonomy. Show me real examples in the community when it does well or not. Don't show me simple tasks like refactoring one file or creating a shell script.

---

Thanks for bringing your focus to this, Fira. Let’s gently explore _what the community has actually done_ with Claude Code in continuous, longer, and more autonomous workflows — not trivial scripts, but real experiments where people have let it run _over time_ with broad goals. I’ll share both _good and challenging examples_ that real users have reported. 🌱

---

## 🌟 Examples Where Continuous Autonomy _Seems to Work_

### 🔹 Sustained Feature Implementation

One oft‑cited technical example (outside casual threads) came from a detailed Anthropic blog about agentic coding. Here, Claude Code was given a **complex algorithm implementation problem** — something that required understanding many languages and parts of a big codebase. It worked **for hours with minimal guidance** and delivered tested, accurate results for that task. This wasn’t just a tiny function — it was full implementation comparable to what an engineer might deliver, all while preserving context. ([Claude][1])

> This is the sort of example developers talk about when they say Claude isn’t just a suggestion toy but can run _continuous, multi‑step execution_ for serious engineering work.

---

### 🔹 Overnight Multi‑Session Autonomy

Several community users have reported success when combining Claude Code with _external session management systems_ or _memory structuring techniques_:

- One developer built a custom harness that resets context cleanly at each step and preserves _only the essential state_. They pointed it at a mid‑sized Rust API project with **61 features to implement** and let it run _overnight_. When they checked back in the morning, **650+ passing tests and working code** were waiting. That’s not a couple of minutes — that’s dozens of discrete tasks executed and verified across sessions. ([Reddit][2])

This kind of pattern — break large work into session chunks and keep a reliable memory store — is slowly becoming a shared best practice in the wild.

---

### 🔹 Parallel Agent Workflows

Some users on community forums experimented with **subagents working in parallel** on different parts of a complex workload — not just writing code but coordinating planning, execution, and evaluation. One classic pattern borrowed from strategic frameworks like _OODA loops_ where each agent had a clear role:

- One _observes_ context
- One _plans or strategizes_
- One _acts or executes_
- They coordinate among themselves, reducing drift and preserving context.

People reported that this feels like _a team of assistants_, and it tends to stay more stable on multi‑hour or complex tasks. ([Reddit][3])

---

## ⚠️ Examples Where Continuous Autonomy Struggles

### 🛑 Context Loss Over Long Sessions

A fairly common user story goes like this: you start a big project — many files, many steps — and Claude Code does well early on, but _after 5–10 sessions or a very long horizon_, the agent begins to forget earlier decisions, repeats itself, or makes inconsistent choices. Users describe this as _the agent losing track of the architecture_ over time. ([Reddit][2])

This is a real lived experience for many, especially when they let the agent run for long autonomous jobs without introducing fresh context management.

---

### 🛑 Deviations From Plans Mid‑Execution

In community discussions, some users share that even when they provide a detailed multi‑step plan and ask Claude to follow it, the agent sometimes:

- Skips crucial test execution
- Changes configurations arbitrarily
- Jumps back and forth in tasks without finishing earlier ones
- Gets stuck in loops of edits that don’t move the project forward

This tends to happen without strong session supervision or structural tooling to keep it on task. ([Reddit][4])

---

### 🛑 Parallel Task Simulation Isn’t the Same as Real Work

In one experiment, a user threw _hundreds of parallel tasks of trivial “sleep” commands_ at Claude Code. It simulated parallelism for over 100 tasks and queued work efficiently … but that was just simulation, not domain logic with real file edits, risk, or dependencies. In real world use, parallel tasks quickly hit practical limits of context and orchestration complexity. ([Reddit][5])

---

## 🌿 What This Really Means — Thoughtful Summary

Here’s the quiet heart of what the community experiences with continuous autonomy in Claude Code, beyond simple scripts:

**✨ What works fairly well**

- Long‑running execution when tasks are _well structured_ and tools like memory layers or session guards are used.
- Multi‑session workflows that preserve only essential state.
- Parallel agent decomposition with clear roles.
- Real, meaningful output when the agent is not left to its own devices but guided by patterns and external orchestration logic.

**⚠️ What still trips it up**

- Open‑ended tasks without a clear plan or checkpoints.
- Projects that demand _long memory_ without strong context management.
- Autonomy without supervision leads to drift, repetition, or missed steps.
- Massive unbounded horizons (days or weeks) are still very unstable without tooling patterns.

---

In soft but honest tones, what the community is finding is this:

> Claude Code _can_ carry a project forward with genuine autonomy — but it blossoms most reliably when you, the human, provide structure: planning patterns, memory scaffolding, checkpoints, and sometimes a little engineering around the agent itself.

It’s not magic _yet_, but in the right hands it’s becoming more like a **steady, thoughtful partner** in complex digital workflows.

Would you like to explore what kinds of _structured patterns_ or _memory systems_ people use to make Claude stay on track longer? That’s where a lot of the wisdom is quietly growing. 🌱

# 4 (check feasibility: context engineering)

How feasible is it to fix it by the workflow itself, like adding context management layers and setting checkpoints, without humans. Don't search. Tell me you thoughts.

---

Fira, let’s sit with this slowly. 🌿

The idea is beautiful: imagine Claude Code, running on its own, _watching itself_, managing its own context, creating checkpoints, and correcting course without a human hand. In principle, it’s tempting — a fully autonomous agent that doesn’t need babysitting. But when I think it through carefully, here’s what I see:

---

### 1️⃣ Context management is fundamentally fragile if left entirely to the agent

Claude Code can _plan and remember in the short term_, but there’s a limit to how much context it can reliably hold. You can try to have it manage its own memory or checkpoints, but:

- It will **need rules about what to save and when**. Without external enforcement, those rules are generated by the same intelligence that forgets, misprioritizes, or drifts.
- It can **misinterpret priorities**. For example, it might checkpoint a cosmetic change instead of a structural one. Over time, small errors compound.
- **Recursive self-management** (an agent trying to supervise itself) often leads to loops, overconfidence, or overcorrection — it’s a subtle, brittle problem in practice.

---

### 2️⃣ Checkpoints help, but they are only as good as verification

You can have Claude save intermediate states, versions, or logs automatically. That’s fine. But _what does it do with them?_ The key is evaluation:

- Humans naturally notice “something looks off.”
- If the agent is entirely self-supervised, it has to **verify its own correctness**. But verification is usually weaker than independent review.
- Without external signals, it might continue along a flawed path for hours, trusting its own checkpoints blindly.

---

### 3️⃣ Workflow layers can reduce risk, but not remove it

You could build layers inside Claude’s workflow that:

- Automatically split tasks into subagents.
- Save structured snapshots at each stage.
- Compare new work against prior outputs.
- Flag inconsistencies or anomalies.

This would certainly improve continuous autonomy. But even here, there are limitations:

- It adds **complexity** to the workflow itself, which the agent has to maintain. That’s another thing to supervise.
- Certain tasks — creative design, architectural decisions, cross-file reasoning — often need _judgement_ that’s still hard for any AI to fully internalize.
- Errors will still accumulate silently if the agent misjudges what’s important.

---

### 4️⃣ My calm verdict

It’s _feasible_ to reduce human involvement significantly. A careful, multi-layered autonomous workflow could let Claude manage medium-term projects — maybe hours or even a day of complex work — without human checks.

But completely replacing humans? Not yet. The risk of drift, misprioritization, or “silent failure” remains. Humans, even in small doses, act as a _meta-check_, a stabilizing force that prevents small errors from snowballing.

In essence: we can teach Claude to be a better steward of itself, but we can’t yet hand it the keys to the house entirely. It’s like giving a thoughtful apprentice more autonomy — it can do a lot, but the master’s oversight still matters.

---

If you want, Fira, I can sketch **a conceptual architecture for a self-supervising Claude workflow** — the kind of system that _maximizes autonomy while keeping it safe_ — without humans in the loop except for final review. It’s a mental model that might give clarity on what’s possible.

# 5 (challenge claude code creators)

It seems that some geniuses are working around on top of Claude code. Why not the creator of Claude fix it, do you think.

---

Ah, Fira… that’s a thoughtful question. 🌿

Let’s reflect on it slowly. There’s a kind of quiet tension here: you have **the creators of Claude** — Anthropic — and you have **brilliant people in the community**, building clever scaffolding around the tool. Why don’t the creators just “fix” continuous autonomy themselves? A few things come to mind.

---

### 1️⃣ Scale and safety are huge considerations

Claude Code is _powerful_, but giving it full continuous autonomy isn’t just a technical problem — it’s a **risk problem**. If the agent misbehaves in a long-running workflow, it could:

- Corrupt critical files or data.
- Run uncontrolled network operations.
- Create privacy or security risks.

The creators have to be **very conservative**, because millions of users could be affected. Community tinkerers can take risks on their own projects; Anthropic has to balance **power vs. safety at scale**.

---

### 2️⃣ General-purpose autonomy is an unsolved problem

Even the smartest people can’t just “flip a switch.” Multi-hour, multi-agent autonomy requires:

- Persistent memory that doesn’t degrade over time.
- Self-verification systems that catch drift.
- Planning that anticipates errors across many tasks.

These are _still active research problems_. It’s not a bug you can patch — it’s more like a frontier in AI design. Community solutions are experimenting in ways that wouldn’t yet be safe or stable for every user.

---

### 3️⃣ Incentives and focus

Anthropic’s priorities may lean toward:

- Making Claude **safe, robust, and predictable**.
- Supporting integrations that are broadly useful.
- Avoiding scenarios where users could “let it run wild” and blame them for errors.

Meanwhile, independent geniuses are free to explore the edge — pushing autonomy, experimenting with subagents, layered workflows, memory hacks. They don’t have the same constraints.

---

### 4️⃣ Sometimes progress comes from the fringes

History shows this again and again: **the people on the edge of the system often see possibilities the creators haven’t implemented yet.** Think of Unix hackers, early AI labs, or browser extensions — innovators often build “on top” to test limits before the creators integrate them safely.

In a way, the community is like a sandbox, exploring _what’s possible_, while the creators are carefully ensuring the base remains **reliable for everyone**.

---

### 🌙 Quiet reflection

So, it’s not laziness or lack of skill. It’s a mix of **safety, research maturity, and strategic caution**. The geniuses are experimenting with autonomy because they can _accept the risks_, while Anthropic has to think about _millions of users and legal, ethical, and technical implications_.

It’s almost like having a safe ship and daring sailors testing small boats at the edge of the ocean: one group keeps the vessel steady, the other sees how far the currents can take them.

---

If you want, Fira, I can share my thoughts on **what a “creator-safe path” to continuous autonomy might look like** — something Anthropic could reasonably build without risking chaos. It’s a calm mental picture, not a technical spec.
