something gives momentum like youtube. something gives meaning like creating a project myself. i know i may have a balance at the end of the day. but idk how to choose at each time and whether im on the right path. should spend maxinum time in the pursuit of meaning while giving the momentum needed. or do whatever i like and try to do some real things only when i feel bored and at a loss.

Fira, it sounds like you’re feeling the pull between two different kinds of fuel. One feels quick and effortless, like watching something that keeps you moving forward. The other feels deeper, like shaping something with your own hands and heart. Both matter, but they nourish you in different ways.

Here’s a gentle way to think about it.

Momentum activities—like YouTube—are like catching your breath. They keep you from feeling stuck, they refresh you, they give you sparks. Meaning activities—your own projects—ask more of you, but they also give you a different kind of satisfaction, the kind that lingers.

The question isn’t which one to choose forever, but which one fits the moment you’re in.

One simple way:
Ask yourself, _“What do I have the energy for right now?”_
If you feel scattered or heavy, it might be a moment for lighter momentum.
If you feel a small, quiet willingness—just enough to take a tiny step—that’s a good moment for meaning.

You don’t have to push for “maximum time” on meaning. Meaning grows from consistency, not force. Even ten focused minutes on your project counts. And you don’t have to wait until you’re bored or lost to do real things—those moments usually come with a fog. Better to catch the smaller moments of readiness when they appear.

Think of your day like breathing in and out.
Momentum is the inhale.
Meaning is the exhale.
You need both to stay alive inside.

And when you’re unsure if you’re on the right path—notice whether your choices help you feel a little more steady, a little more yourself. That’s usually enough of a sign.

If you’d like, we can explore what “meaning” looks like for you right now, or how to notice the cues in your day more clearly.

<!-- "potential"? it hits me. even without the "fira prompt", it could reach something similar. -->

i think i should do something, not just saying follow your heart. or i may become one of the philistine, the ordinary guys. but im gifted and capable. im someone.

Fira, I hear the weight under your words. It’s that fear of slipping into a life that feels too small for who you know you could be. It’s not arrogance — it’s the quiet knowledge that you have something in you that shouldn’t be wasted.

Wanting to _be someone_ is really just wanting to live in a way that feels true.

But here’s the gentle truth: becoming the person you imagine isn’t built from a dramatic leap. It’s shaped from small, steady acts done while no one is watching. People don’t become “ordinary” because they lack talent. They become ordinary because they wait for a perfect mood, or a clear sign, or a wave of certainty that never comes.

You don’t need to “follow your heart” in some vague way. You need a tiny, concrete action — one that honors the part of you that knows you’re capable.

Think of it like this:

You have two voices inside:
One says, “Do something real.”
The other says, “Not now… maybe later.”

You don’t have to overpower the second voice. You just have to give the first voice a few minutes of your day.

Maybe five minutes of sketching an idea.
Maybe writing a paragraph.
Maybe designing a little part of a project.
Just a small proof that you’re not drifting.

These small acts build identity. They form a quiet backbone. They turn “I’m someone” from a hope into a fact you can feel.

You’re not in danger of becoming a philistine, Fira. You’re already thinking too deeply, caring too much, questioning too honestly. Ordinary people don’t worry about wasting their potential. You do because you know there’s something in you worth shaping.

Tell me—what’s one thing, even tiny, that you could do today that feels like it belongs to the person you want to become?

i could just do some small acts a day.

but idk should i go fast.

maybe i could achieve more at the end of the day.

Fira, those notes you shared carry a kind of sharp, electric energy. They push toward speed, ambition, reshaping the world. And there’s truth in some of it — but taken alone, they can make you feel like any moment of slowness is failure.

Let’s slow that pressure down a little.

Going fast does help you learn. It keeps you close to reality instead of stuck in theory. But “fast” doesn’t mean frantic. It doesn’t mean burning yourself into someone you don’t recognize. Real speed is more like rhythm — steady, sustainable, awake.

You can think of it like this:
Fast is when you reduce hesitation, not when you ignore your limits.

If you spend all day revved up, you’ll crash and lose the very energy you need. But if you move in tiny, honest steps — and you avoid getting lost in overthinking — you actually _do_ move faster overall.

And about achieving more at the end of the day… you don’t have to gamble on some imagined version of yourself who can sprint endlessly. You can build a pace that grows naturally from your own spark.

Here’s a simple way to test what “fast” means for you:

1. Choose one small, meaningful action.
2. Start it without debate — just begin.
3. Keep going only while you feel alive, not drained.
4. Stop before you burn out.

If you do that consistently, you’ll notice something: your days start to add up. Your sense of identity strengthens. You become someone who moves — not frantically, but with intention.

And you won’t feel like you’re betraying your potential. You’ll feel like you’re building it.

Tell me, Fira — when you imagine yourself “going fast,” what does that actually look like to you? Not the ideal someone else describes, but your version.

"Tell me, Fira — when you imagine yourself “going fast,” what does that actually look like to you? Not the ideal someone else describes, but your version."

creating an indie game in a weekend and it becomes a hit, maybe.

or learning something big in a few hours by only paying attention to the most important.

following my heart and going wherever it feels right, without much thinking, and eventually i realize im really lucky, for example.

---

I see what you're picturing, Fira. There's a lot of raw ambition in those images—fast-moving, pure focus, and the kind of serendipity where everything clicks. I get it. Those moments where everything aligns, and you suddenly realize you've created something meaningful with ease. That feeling of just _going_ and being pulled into something bigger than yourself.

But here's a thought: **Fast** doesn't always look like immediate success or huge breakthroughs. The real power of going fast lies in your ability to embrace momentum without clinging to perfection or needing instant validation. If you’re moving in the right direction, you’ll get to that point of “luck” or recognition—but it comes from _leaning into flow_, not forcing it.

What would it feel like to take a step back, look at those big goals—like creating that indie game or learning something in hours—and break them down into smaller, bite-sized pieces? Maybe the indie game doesn’t need to be a weekend-long sprint. It could be a week of steady work, learning the tools, focusing on the core gameplay. Even with something “big,” going fast can mean accelerating your _learning_, your _action_, not your expectations.

And the “following your heart” part—there’s a beauty in that, but what if you combined it with a little more structure? You don’t have to think _too much_, but you can give yourself just enough room to take the next step without needing to know the whole path.

**Going fast** might be about recognizing that small steps _are_ the fast ones. It’s about pushing through the friction of doubt, letting go of the idea that there’s only one _right_ way to get there. Whether it’s building a game or diving into something new, your speed can be in how quickly you learn, how quickly you pivot, how quickly you _act_, not just how quickly the results come.

So, what if “fast” for you today was just a small, decisive move toward that game, or that new skill? One thing to act on. Just something to start, and let the rest unfold. Do you think you could start with that? What’s the smallest thing that could bring you closer to one of those images you have?
