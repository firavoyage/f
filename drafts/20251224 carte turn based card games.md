im creating indie games. what are the great turn based card games.

---

I love that you’re thinking deeply about the games that inspire you, Fira—like we’re sitting together and sharing thoughtful ideas. Here are some great **turn-based card games** that many indie creators and players consider meaningful, clever, or influential. These might spark ideas for your own projects or simply be warm companions on your gaming journey:

#### 🌿 Classics and Pillars of the Genre

These are the games that shaped a lot of what we think “turn-based card play” means in video games:

- **Slay the Spire** – Gentle loop of building a deck, climbing a spire, and choosing paths that matter. It blended strategy with surprising depth and became a touchstone for many indie deckbuilders. ([Steam Store][1])
- **Inscryption** – This one blends card combat with narrative, puzzles, and unexpected twists. It feels like a story told through cards as much as through words. ([Steam Store][2])

#### 📜 Great Deckbuilders with Their Own Voices

Games here lean into turn-based card combat with twists—mechanics that feel familiar but fresh:

- **Monster Train** – A deckbuilder with multi-floor combat and lots of tactical decisions each turn. ([GameSpot][3])
- **Wildfrost** – Streamlined but strategic deckbuilding loops with a chill aesthetic. ([GameSpot][3])
- **Griftlands** – Blends narrative choices with card battles, so every encounter feels like part of a lived story. ([GameSpot][3])
- **Banners of Ruin** – You command a ragtag party, each with their own cards and roles, in challenging turn-by-turn battles. ([GameSpot][3])
- **Vault of the Void** – A minimalist take that lets you really savor the building and culling of your deck. ([GameSpot][3])
- **Roguebook** – Combines two characters’ decks and lets you explore a world map like a magical book. ([Wikipedia][4])

#### 🧠 Indie and Niche Gems (Good for Creativity and Inspiration)

These titles strike interesting chords in design and mood:

- **Trials of Fire** – Merges tactical turn-based combat with deckbuilding in a gritty, post-apocalyptic world. ([Wikipedia][5])
- **Foretales** – A story-rich deckbuilder where card fights and narrative choices blend beautifully. ([Wikipedia][6])

#### ✨ Thoughts for Your Path

If you’re thinking about your own turn-based card game, one gentle insight is this:
The games that stick with people _feel meaningful each turn_. Every card played has a little story or decision behind it—whether it’s a choice about risk, about identity, or about how a character grows. That doesn’t need to be flashy; it just needs to feel deeply _yours_.

When you look at these games, notice how they balance simplicity and depth: they make the player _think_, not _rush_. And in your own work, that space between turns can become a place for calm strategy, intuition… maybe even wonder.

If you want, tell me what kind of turn-based card game you’re imagining—mechanics, mood, story—and we can explore that together.
