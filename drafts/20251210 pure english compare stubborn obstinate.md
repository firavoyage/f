### Nuance in Meaning and Usage

**Stubborn** often focuses on the **act of holding firm**.
*   It can suggest tenacity or determination, not just negativity.
*   *Example (Neutral/Positive):* "Her **stubborn** refusal to give up led to the project's eventual success."
*   *Example (Negative):* "He's too **stubborn** to ask for directions when he's lost."

**Obstinate** focuses on the **motive behind the refusal**—often seen as irrational, petty, or obstructive.
*   It implies a stubbornness that is irritating and unjustified.

### Analogy
*   **Stubborn** is like a **rock**—hard to move, solid, immovable. This can be good (a foundation) or bad (an obstacle).
*   **Obstinate** is like a **mule digging its heels in**—it implies an active, willful resistance against guidance or sense.

### Summary and Practical Advice

*   Use **stubborn** for general, everyday situations. It's the safer, more widely applicable term.
*   Use **obstinate** when you want to strongly criticize the **unreasonableness** of the behavior. It's a more powerful and negative descriptor.

**In short: All obstinate people are stubborn, but not all stubborn people are obstinate.** The key distinction is the perceived *reasonableness* of the inflexibility.
