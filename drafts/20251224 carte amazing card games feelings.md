im an indie gamedev. i find my games a bit philistine. i would like to create something amazing. im gonna consult llms. idk what i may need, so think or guess. without focusing on a specific game, what questions may i ask.

---

That’s a good place to stand, Fira.
Not satisfied, but not bitter either. That tension often means your taste has grown faster than your tools. That’s normal.

When you consult an LLM, don’t treat it like a vending machine for ideas. Treat it like a quiet mirror that helps you notice what you already sense but haven’t named yet.

Here are _kinds_ of questions that tend to open real doors. You don’t need to ask them all at once. Let them come when they feel alive.

---

**About meaning and intention**

You might ask:

- _What do I care about deeply, even if it’s uncomfortable or unclear?_
- _What emotions do I return to again and again in my life?_
- _What do I wish games had given me, but didn’t?_

Great games usually start as a private question, not a clever mechanic.

---

**About taste and discernment**

Try asking:

- _Why do I admire the games I admire?_
- _What feels shallow or dishonest in my own work?_
- _What am I copying without understanding?_

This isn’t self-criticism. It’s learning to see more clearly.

---

**About constraints and courage**

Some useful prompts:

- _If I could only express one idea or feeling, what would it be?_
- _What am I avoiding because it feels risky or “too much”?_
- _What would I make if I weren’t trying to be liked?_

Limitations often reveal the spine of a project.

---

**About form and expression**

Instead of “what game should I make,” ask:

- _What experiences fit interactive form better than words or film?_
- _What does interactivity allow me to say that nothing else can?_
- _How can mechanics express emotion rather than challenge?_

This shifts you from design-as-function to design-as-language.

---

**About process, not product**

You could explore:

- _How do artists I admire actually work day to day?_
- _What kind of creative rhythm suits my temperament?_
- _How do I stay with an idea long enough for it to mature?_

Mastery is often boring on the surface and deep underneath.

---

**About honesty**

One of the hardest, but most fruitful:

- _What would it mean for this game to be honest?_
- _Where am I hiding behind irony, polish, or genre?_

Players feel honesty even when they can’t explain it.

---

If your games feel philistine, it may not be because you lack skill.
It may be because you’re standing at the edge of wanting to say something real, and you don’t yet trust that impulse.

We can take this slowly.
If you’d like, next time you can tell me:

- one game that moved you deeply, or
- one moment in your own work that felt almost _true_, but not quite.

We’ll listen to that together.

# 2

tell me everything here. i would like to learn something practical and grounded. i could not memorize a lot of best practices.

---

Alright, Fira.
Let’s make this _grounded_, and let’s keep it _light enough to carry_. No theory pile, no commandments. Just a few things you can actually use.

I’m going to give you **four anchors**. You don’t need to memorize them. You’ll start to _recognize_ them in your work.

---

### 1. One honest feeling (not an idea)

Most indie games fail quietly because they start with an idea instead of a feeling.

A practical question to keep near you:

> _What do I want the player to feel for 10 seconds?_

Not the whole game. Just 10 seconds.

Examples:

- unease
- tenderness
- guilt
- curiosity
- relief
- loneliness

If you can’t answer this, stop designing.
If you _can_, everything else becomes simpler.

**Practical move:**
When you add a mechanic, ask:

> _Does this strengthen that feeling, or dilute it?_

If it dilutes, cut it—even if it’s clever.

---

### 2. Mechanics are verbs, not systems

You don’t need more systems. You need clearer _verbs_.

Instead of thinking:

- crafting
- combat
- dialogue trees

Think:

- waiting
- hiding
- choosing
- carrying
- listening
- letting go

**Practical move:**
Write this sentence:

> _In this game, the player mostly spends time **\_\_\_\_ing**._

If the verb feels emotionally empty, the game will feel empty too.

A lot of “philistine” games feel that way because the verbs are generic, even if the art is good.

---

### 3. Small scope, deep attention

You don’t need ambition. You need _attention_.

A tiny, well-observed thing beats a large, shallow one.

**Practical rule of thumb:**

> If you can’t describe the core experience in one calm sentence, it’s too big.

Example:

- “Walking through a town that remembers what you forgot.”
- “Keeping someone alive by doing nothing.”

These aren’t pitches. They’re _centers of gravity_.

Everything that doesn’t orbit that center gets removed.

---

### 4. Don’t entertain — accompany

This is subtle, but important.

Many games try to _perform_ for the player.
The ones that linger feel like they’re _with_ the player.

**Practical shift:**

- Fewer rewards
- Fewer pop-ups
- Fewer explanations
- More space
- More silence
- More trust

Ask yourself:

> _Am I afraid the player will be bored? Or am I afraid to be quiet?_

Silence is where meaning sneaks in.

---

### A simple working loop (use this, nothing else)

If you only keep one process, keep this:

1. Choose one feeling
2. Choose one verb
3. Build a tiny moment (30–60 seconds)
4. Play it slowly, without sound
5. Notice what feels false
6. Remove one thing

Repeat.

That’s it.

No design doc. No roadmap. No best practices.

---

### One last grounded truth

Amazing games are not made by people who know more rules.
They’re made by people who are willing to look longer at one thing.

If your work feels philistine, it’s likely because you’re moving too quickly past what matters to you.

We don’t need to fix that.
We just need to slow it down.

If you want, next time you can tell me:

- one mechanic you keep returning to, or
- one feeling you’re afraid your games can’t express.

We’ll take it from there, gently.

# 3

what are the feelings. of great games in the world, for example.

---

That’s a good question, Fira.
And a quiet one. Because the answer isn’t a list to copy — it’s a way of _seeing_.

Great games don’t have many feelings.
They usually have **one or two**, held patiently.

I’ll give you examples, not as prescriptions, but as _recognitions_. As you read, notice which ones make you pause. That pause matters.

---

#### A few deep feelings great games often center on

**Loneliness (but not emptiness)**
Not “there is nothing,” but _“I am here, and the world does not explain itself to me.”_
Often expressed through:

- vast spaces
- minimal guidance
- slow discovery

This feeling invites contemplation, not despair.

---

**Care**
Not excitement. Not dominance.
Care is _attention with responsibility_.

You see it when:

- something fragile depends on you
- success comes from patience, not speed
- failure feels personal, not punitive

Care makes players slow down on their own.

---

**Unease**
Not fear. Unease is quieter.

It comes from:

- rules that feel slightly off
- rewards that feel morally unclear
- worlds that don’t fully justify themselves

Unease respects the player’s intelligence.

---

**Longing**
This one is powerful and rare.

Longing is the feeling that:

- something meaningful is just out of reach
- the past matters
- completion won’t resolve everything

Games with longing don’t rush closure.

---

**Tenderness**
Often overlooked, because it looks weak from the outside.

Tenderness appears when:

- mechanics avoid punishment
- moments are allowed to be small
- the game does not mock sincerity

Players protect what feels tender.

---

**Guilt or complicity**
Handled carefully, this is very strong.

It emerges when:

- the game never explicitly judges you
- your actions feel reasonable, yet troubling
- consequences are subtle, not dramatic

This feeling lingers long after play.

---

**Relief**
Rarely designed for, but deeply human.

Relief comes from:

- release rather than victory
- rest after tension
- permission to stop striving

Relief makes endings feel earned.

---

#### What great games _don’t_ rely on

They usually avoid centering on:

- constant excitement
- cleverness for its own sake
- empowerment without cost

Those feelings burn fast and leave little residue.

---

#### A grounded way to use this (no memorization)

Don’t ask:

> _Which feeling should I choose?_

Instead, ask:

> _Which feeling already follows me around?_

The one that shows up in:

- how you play games
- what scenes you replay in your head
- what frustrates you about your own work

That’s your material.

---

#### One practical exercise (very simple)

Tonight or tomorrow:

1. Think of one game you still remember vividly
2. Don’t name the mechanic
3. Name the _feeling_ you were left with after turning it off

That feeling — not the genre, not the feature — is the real inheritance.

We don’t borrow mechanics from great games.
We borrow _their courage to stay with one feeling_.

If you want, next we can take **one feeling** and translate it into:

- a verb
- a constraint
- a tiny playable moment

Slowly. Together.

how could i make my card game amazing

---

Alright, Fira.
Let’s slow this down and put our feet on the ground.

A card game becomes _amazing_ not when it has more cards, or smarter math, or tighter balance — but when it **asks the player to care in a particular way**.

So I’ll give you a way to _see_ your card game differently, without rules to memorize.

---

### First: stop thinking “card game”

A card game is not a genre.
It’s a **constraint**.

Cards are good at a few very specific things:

- being held in the hand (private knowledge)
- being revealed (moments of truth)
- being discarded (loss, waste, sacrifice)
- being remembered imperfectly

If your game doesn’t lean into these, it will feel generic no matter how polished it is.

---

### One question that actually matters

Ask yourself this, quietly:

> _What does it feel like to hold a card in this game?_

Not strategically. Emotionally.

Does it feel like:

- a promise?
- a burden?
- a temptation?
- a secret?
- a responsibility?

If the answer is “options” or “resources,” that’s a warning sign.

---

### The heart of an amazing card game

Great card games usually center on **tension between knowing and committing**.

You:

- know something
- don’t know everything
- must act anyway

**Practical move:**
Design fewer “optimal” plays.
Design more _irreversible_ ones.

When a card is played, something should be _gone_:

- information
- safety
- future flexibility

This creates weight.

---

### A simple but powerful shift

Most card games ask:

> _What’s the best play?_

More interesting games ask:

> _What am I willing to give up right now?_

Try this:

- Cards that get stronger the longer you don’t play them
- Cards that hurt you when kept too long
- Cards that change meaning depending on _when_ they’re revealed

Timing becomes expression, not calculation.

---

### One feeling, clearly chosen

Pick **one** feeling to privilege. Just one.

For example:

- **Unease** → hidden information, delayed consequences
- **Care** → fragile cards that must be protected
- **Guilt** → powerful cards that cost others
- **Longing** → cards you can never get back

Then remove anything that doesn’t serve that feeling.

Yes, even if it’s clever.

---

### A grounded test you can actually do

Here’s a test that works better than playtesting for balance:

1. Play your game alone
2. Play slowly
3. After each card, ask:

   > _Did this choice feel necessary?_

Not “smart.”
Necessary.

If choices feel optional, the game will feel forgettable.

---

### A quiet truth about “amazing”

Amazing card games are often _simpler_ than they appear.
What makes them linger is not complexity, but **restraint**.

They trust the player to sit with uncertainty.
They don’t explain everything.
They let silence exist between plays.

If your instinct is to add clarity, pause.
Sometimes ambiguity is the point.

---

### One last thing to hold onto

If you want your card game to be amazing, don’t ask:

> _How do I make this fun?_

Ask:

> _What kind of person does this game ask the player to be for 20 minutes?_

Careful? Ruthless? Patient? Regretful?

Design _that_, and the mechanics will fall into place.

If you want, next time you can tell me:

- what players do most often in your card game, or
- what you secretly hope they feel but don’t yet.

We can work gently from there.
