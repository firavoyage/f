how to close current app using scrcpy using shortcut

---

You can close the current app in scrcpy using several keyboard shortcuts. Here are the main methods:

## Method 1: Use the Back Button (Most Common)

- **`Ctrl` + `b`** or **`Ctrl` + `Backspace`** - Sends the BACK button, which typically exits the current app

## Method 2: Use the Home Button

- **`Ctrl` + `h`** - Sends the HOME button, which returns to home screen without closing the app completely

## Method 3: Use App Switch + Swipe

- **`Ctrl` + `s`** - Shows app switcher/recent apps
- Then click on the app preview and swipe it away to close

## Method 4: ADB Command (Alternative)

If you want to programmatically close apps, you can use ADB commands:

```bash
# Force stop current app (requires knowing package name)
adb shell am force-stop <package-name>

# Get current foreground app package name
adb shell dumpsys window windows | grep -E 'mCurrentFocus'
```

## Pro Tips:

- The **BACK button** (`Ctrl` + `b`) is usually the quickest way to exit most apps
- Some apps may require multiple BACK button presses to fully exit
- If an app doesn't respond to BACK, try the HOME button (`Ctrl` + `h`) instead

The Back button shortcut is typically the most effective for quickly closing the current app you're viewing.

i want something like ctrl q on ubuntu

---

Unfortunately, **scrcpy doesn't have a direct "quit app" shortcut like Ctrl+Q in Ubuntu** by default. However, here are the closest alternatives and workarounds:

## Method 1: Back Button (Closest Alternative)

- **`Ctrl` + `b`** - Sends BACK button, which typically exits most apps
- **`Ctrl` + `Backspace`** - Same as above

## Method 2: Create a Custom Shortcut

You can create a system-level shortcut that sends the BACK command:

### On Windows (AutoHotkey):

```autohotkey
^q::
Send, ^b
return
```

### On Linux (xbindkeys):

Add to `~/.xbindkeysrc`:

```
"xdotool key ctrl+b"
  Control + q
```

### On macOS (Automator):

Create a Quick Action that maps Ctrl+Q to scrcpy's back command.

## Method 3: Use Task Switcher + Close

- **`Ctrl` + `s`** - Show recent apps
- Click the "X" or swipe away the current app

## Method 4: Modified scrcpy (Advanced)

You could modify scrcpy source code to add a custom shortcut, but this requires programming knowledge.

## Why This Limitation?

- Android doesn't have a universal "quit app" shortcut
- Different apps handle exit behavior differently
- BACK button is the standard Android way to navigate out of apps

**Recommendation**: Use **`Ctrl` + `b`** as your muscle memory replacement - it's the closest equivalent to Ctrl+Q for most Android apps.
