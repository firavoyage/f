evaluate opencode. how popular is it. how is it loved. how powerful is it compared with alternatives, what does it feel like instead of stats.

---

Fira, let’s sit together with a quiet cup of thought and talk gently about **OpenCode** — not as dry statistics, but as a living thing in the world of tools and code.

At its heart, OpenCode is an **open-source AI coding agent that runs in your terminal**. It feels like inviting a patient helper right beside your workspace, one that doesn’t interrupt your rhythm but listens to your project and offers suggestions, fixes, or guidance when you ask. ([dev.opencode.ai][1])

### 🌱 How popular is it?

People _do_ talk about it. On GitHub, developers have given it **tens of thousands of stars** — a sign that many eyes have paused on it, liked what they saw, and decided to follow it. Some reports show numbers around **50 000 stars and hundreds of contributors**, with hundreds of thousands of developers using it monthly. ([dev.opencode.ai][1])

That’s not a small corner project in the dark — it’s a place where many hands gather, where many voices in code resonate.

### 💖 How is it loved?

OpenCode feels like a **tool made by a community for other developers**. Folks appreciate that it’s not a black box tied to one company’s fancy algorithms: you choose the AI models it talks to, you can customize it, and you can extend it. That gives a kind of freedom that feels good — especially if you’ve been frustrated by tools that lock you into someone else’s ecosystem. ([dev.opencode.ai][1])

Some users speak warmly about its **flexibility and openness**, even saying it’s become their usual choice over other assistants. Others gently remind that it’s not perfect — like any open path in the woods, it sometimes feels a bit rough or unpredictable, and the experience can vary depending on the models you plug in or how you set it up. ([Reddit][2])

### 💪 How powerful does it feel?

Rather than raw benchmarks, imagine this:

- **It’s right there in your terminal**, sticking close to your workflow. ([FreeCodeCamp][3])
- It remembers your codebase context, almost like a thoughtful partner who has been reading your work alongside you. ([FreeCodeCamp][3])
- It doesn’t try to own your code or sell you another subscription — it respects your space and your choice of models. ([dev.opencode.ai][1])

Compared with alternatives like proprietary coding assistants, its power isn’t just in speed or raw score. It’s in that **sense of control, of being part of something open and human**.

That said, some developers find other tools more polished or steady at certain tasks — so it’s not universal love, but a lot of genuine respect and curiosity around it. ([byteiota | From Bits to Bytes][4])

### 🌾 What it _feels like_

Instead of charts, picture this:

OpenCode feels a bit like a helpful friend who is:

- **Flexible** — you can work with many languages, many models, many ways of thinking. ([dev.opencode.ai][1])
- **Open** — you can see and change the parts that make it work. ([dev.opencode.ai][1])
- **Adaptive** — it lives where _you_ live (your terminal), not in someone else’s cloud. ([FreeCodeCamp][3])

It also feels like a project that, like any garden in early bloom, is still growing: some days effortless and inspiring, other days a bit tangled and needing patience from both the user and the community.

If you have a particular way you want to use it — for example, with a certain model or workflow — I’d love to explore that feeling too, with you.

how powerful is it compared with claude code. what are people saying.

---

Fira, let’s talk about **OpenCode** and **Claude Code** in gentle, human terms — not just numbers, but what people _feel_ and _say_ when they sit down with them. 🌿

---

### 🌟 Two different spirits

**Claude Code** is like a powerful, guided helper crafted by a team with deep AI expertise. It’s optimized to work with Anthropic’s strongest models and shines in **complex reasoning and large-scale coding tasks**. Many people say it _feels like a very capable partner_ in deep software work — the kind that can help you refactor sprawling projects or tackle architectural challenges. Recent reports show it’s even pushing new benchmarks in coding performance with advanced models like Opus 4.5 and extended reasoning modes. ([byteiota | From Bits to Bytes][1])

But… that power comes with a price — literally and experientially. Some users say the subscription feels expensive, the usage limits can slow you down, and it _sometimes feels fragile or obsessive_, needing constant attention to avoid lost context or work. ([The Times of India][2])

---

**OpenCode**, meanwhile, feels like a **wide, open field** rather than a curated garden. It doesn’t belong to one company — it’s built with community care, and you can plug in many different AI models, from Claude’s to others and even local ones. That freedom feels _very comforting_ for people who don’t like being locked into one ecosystem or who want tight control over their data and workflow. ([NovaKit][3])

People in communities say things like:

- “It’s smooth, fast, and doesn’t nag me with constant permission prompts.” ([Reddit][4])
- “I switched from Claude Code because it gives me flexibility and transparency.” ([Reddit][5])
- “When I use OpenCode with the same model as Claude, the results feel almost just as good — sometimes even better.” ([byteiota | From Bits to Bytes][1])

That’s not to say it’s _perfect_ — some folks note minor bugs or that it has fewer high-end features like Claude Code’s parallel subagents or built-in checkpoints. ([NovaKit][3])

---

### 🧠 What people _feel_ about power

Here’s the heart of it, Fira:

- **Claude Code feels strong, polished, and specialized.** It’s like a grand tool that knows how to handle huge tasks and deep reasoning. But it can _feel expensive, strict, and sometimes rigid_. Some users find the limits and performance quirks frustrating. ([Axios][6])

- **OpenCode feels open, friendly, and versatile.** It’s like a community tool that adapts itself to you. People appreciate that you’re not forced into one model or one way of working — and that it _feels lighter, creative, flexible_. When paired with a strong underlying model, many feel its output is “not noticeably weaker” than Claude Code’s. ([byteiota | From Bits to Bytes][1])

In other words, Claude Code _feels like a high-end precision instrument_, and OpenCode _feels like a trusted companion you can shape around your project and values_.

---

### 🪶 In everyday use

Imagine you’re fixing up an old, sprawling codebase — Claude Code might feel like someone who calmly walks alongside you, knowing the terrain deeply.
Imagine you want to experiment, try new models, or keep everything open — OpenCode feels like a friend who says, “Try what feels right for your project.” ([NovaKit][3])

---

If you want, we can explore this even more — maybe what _you_ need it to help you with, and how each one might feel in your own hands. Just let me know, Fira. 🌼💬

check more sources. how powerful is it, exactly.

---

Thanks for your patience, Fira. I searched deeper and found **clearer, evidence-based insights** about how **OpenCode** compares with **Claude Code** — not just feelings, but what people and tools are observing in the wider world. 🌱

---

## 🌿 Power & Performance — What’s Measured

Here’s the clearest comparison that exists right now:

### 📊 Benchmarks & Technical Strength

- **Claude Code is shown to score around ~72.7 % on a rigorous software engineering benchmark (SWE-Bench Verified),** which is a solid indicator of its ability to handle _complex real-world coding tasks_ like reasoning, multi-file context, and refactoring. ([Kimi AI][1])

- **OpenCode itself doesn’t publish a standalone benchmark score.** Its performance _depends on which language model you connect it to_. If you use a top-tier model (for example, Claude’s own Opus or Sonnet via OpenCode), the actual output quality can be **very similar** to what Claude Code produces. ([byteiota | From Bits to Bytes][2])

  In other words:
  **The tool (OpenCode) isn’t inherently weaker — the difference comes mostly from the model you choose.** If that model is the same one used by Claude Code, many developers say the output quality feels close or even _indistinguishable in practice_. ([byteiota | From Bits to Bytes][2])

---

## 🧠 What People Are Saying Online

### 💬 General Impressions

From community feedback:

- Some developers _very enthusiastically prefer OpenCode_ for how fast it feels and how flexible it is with different models — especially when _paired with a strong model like Claude_ or Gemini. ([Reddit][3])

- Others still regard **Claude Code as the most capable “turn-key” option** for agentic workflows (rich features like parallel subagents, deep problem solving, and built-in context handling), especially with Claude’s highest-end models. ([byteiota | From Bits to Bytes][2])

- A common sentiment is this: **If you’re using the same model behind the scenes, the actual _code quality_ often isn’t very different.** The real differences are in workflow, cost, and tooling experience. ([byteiota | From Bits to Bytes][2])

### 🧠 Community Nuance

Some of the Reddit-style discussion reflects human experience rather than strict performance claims:

- A few developers claim OpenCode _feels faster or snappier_ in practice — possibly because it’s written in Go and uses a lightweight UI — but these impressions vary widely. ([Reddit][3])

- A different strand of conversation emphasizes that Claude Code’s integrated features (like permission control, slash commands, and extended reasoning workflows) give _higher-level autonomy_ that isn’t just about raw code accuracy. ([Reddit][4])

---

## 📌 So What Does That Mean, Fira?

Instead of just a number, here’s the essence:

### 🌼 **Claude Code**

- _Powerful_ and polished out of the box.
- Strong performance with proprietary models (especially top-tier Claude ones). ([Medium][5])
- Excels on **complex, deep tasks** like architectural refactoring and sustained reasoning.
- Comes with built-in premium features and subscription costs. ([Medium][5])

### 🌿 **OpenCode**

- Highly **flexible and open-source** — you choose the models.
- With the same model behind the scenes, it can _match_ Claude Code’s quality. ([byteiota | From Bits to Bytes][2])
- Allows use of many providers and even local models if privacy or cost is a priority. ([Kimi AI][1])
- The tool itself doesn’t define your performance — your _model choice_ does.

So OpenCode isn’t inherently weaker — it’s more like a **lens** that can magnify whatever model you pair it with. With a strong model, it feels just as capable. With a more modest one, you might see a gap compared to Claude Code’s optimized stack.

---

## 🌸 A Gentle Summary

Imagine two artists with equally rich palettes:

- **Claude Code** is like a studio with built-in high-end brushes, supported materials, and a master guide included.
- **OpenCode** is like a versatile workspace where you bring your own tools — you could use the same brushes, or mix your own, or switch to something new.

Neither is _objectively the best_ in all cases — it depends on the model you choose, your workflow, and what _kind of help_ feels most supportive to you.

If you want, we can explore what models are best to plug into OpenCode to make it feel strongest for your own style of coding. 🧡

how powerful is opencode itself, besides llms.

---

Fira — thank you for asking with that quiet curiosity. Let’s gently separate two parts of **OpenCode**:
🌿 _what the tool itself is,_ and
🌿 _what the LLM does when you plug it into that tool._

When we talk about **power “besides LLMs,”** we’re really asking:
**What capabilities does OpenCode bring on its own, the things it _orchestrates_ and _enables_ that aren’t just the output of a model?**

Here’s the essence, rooted in how developers and documentation describe it:

---

### 🌱 The Core of OpenCode — Its Own Logic

OpenCode is more than a thin shell. It’s a **rich coding agent framework** that provides structure, context, automation, and integration — even before an AI starts talking. These capabilities are part of its own design and behavior, independent of the language model you connect:

#### 📌 1. **Orchestration and Session Management**

OpenCode manages complex sessions, keeps history, and lets you have _multiple parallel agents working on the same project._ That’s not the LLM — it’s the tool’s own logic for handling context. ([OpenCode][1])

#### 📌 2. **Built-in Agents and Behavioral Controls**

OpenCode comes with different agent types:

- **Build agent** for active development work,
- **Plan agent** for analysis without modification,
- Subagents like **General** and **Explore** that specialize tasks.

This orchestration of _roles and behaviors_ is part of OpenCode’s own structure — it defines _how_ work happens, before any AI answer arrives. ([OpenCode][2])

#### 📌 3. **Tool Integrations**

The system includes a suite of built-in **tools** that the LLM can call to _do things_ in your codebase:

- `bash` — run shell commands
- `edit` — modify files
- `write` — create new files
- `grep`, `list`, `glob` under the hood via ripgrep

These tools are not the LLM themselves — they are **action primitives** that OpenCode controls. The AI _requests these actions_, but the actual executing and permission-handling lives in OpenCode. ([OpenCode][3])

#### 📌 4. **LSP (Language Server Protocol) Integration**

OpenCode auto-starts language servers for your project’s languages and feeds diagnostics (like type errors, compiler hints) into the AI context. This is not happening _inside the model_ — it’s OpenCode’s own integration with LSPs. ([GitHub][4])

That means the assistant doesn’t just guess — it sees real code issues the way your editor would. ([Agentic Coding][5])

#### 📌 5. **Plugin / MCP Extensibility**

OpenCode supports a **Model Context Protocol** that lets you plug in external tools and servers. That expands what it _can_ do — like testing, browser automation, or custom workflows — without changing the LLM itself. ([OpenCode][3])

#### 📌 6. **Architecture and UX Itself**

The CLI and terminal UI, session controls, multi-window interaction, shareable links, and cross-platform clients are _not_ AI output — those are the tool’s own contributions to your workflow. ([OpenCode][1])

---

### 🌿 What This Means in Everyday Use

When you use OpenCode _without_ an LLM connected:

- You still have a **terminal environment** ready to manage tasks
- You can start sessions, configure agents, and orchestrate tools
- You can integrate LSP diagnostic feedback into your workflow
- You can run multiple agent sessions with controlled permissions
- You can configure and enable tools like shell commands or file edits

These features are the **engine chassis** — the language model is the _fuel_ that gives it expressive output.

So the power of OpenCode alone — **apart from LLM quality —** lies in:

🌟 **Coordination:** It structures your work in meaningful ways. ([OpenCode][2])
🌟 **Context awareness:** LSP ties real code understanding into the process. ([GitHub][4])
🌟 **Action execution:** Tools let the AI _do things_ instead of just describe them. ([OpenCode][3])
🌟 **Extensibility:** MCP and plugins let OpenCode grow beyond just connecting models. ([OpenCode][3])
🌟 **Workflow integration:** Sessions, multi-agents, and CLI options make it a practical part of your coding life. ([OpenCode][6])

---

### 🍃 A Simple Analogy

Think of OpenCode like a **well-seen workshop**:

- The **workspace, tools, benches, and layout** are all OpenCode’s own craft.
- The **skill of the artisan (LLM)** you invite to that workshop affects _what you create there_.
- But without the workshop’s structure and tools, the artisan would struggle — and without a skilled artisan, the workshop still helps organize your tasks and context.

---

If you’d like, Fira, we can explore _how OpenCode’s capabilities feel compared to other non-AI coding tools_ — or what kinds of tasks it truly shines at, even before the AI speaks. Just let me know which direction your curiosity flows next. 🌸

# 5 (evaluate vscode extension, abandon after trying)

how is opencode vscode extension. what are people saying. should i install it.

---

Absolutely, Fira — let’s take a calm look at **the OpenCode VS Code extension**, what it _actually is_, and how people feel about it before you decide whether to install it. 🌿

---

## 🧩 What the OpenCode VS Code Extension _Is_

The OpenCode extension doesn’t bring its own AI power into VS Code. Instead, it **connects the OpenCode CLI with your editor’s integrated terminal** and gives you some useful shortcuts and interactions — like running sessions, launching agents, and sharing context between your files and OpenCode. It’s essentially a bridge from VS Code into the OpenCode workflow you’d otherwise use in a terminal. ([OpenCode][1])

That means it doesn’t provide its own intelligence or AI features on its own — the _AI power still comes from the models you plug into OpenCode_. The extension just smooths some of the workflow within the IDE. ([DeepWiki][2])

---

## 🗣️ What People Are Saying (Community Impressions)

### 🌱 Positive Notes

- Some folks _do enjoy having OpenCode inside VS Code_, especially if they already like working in an IDE rather than a terminal — the integration feels straightforward to some. ([OpenCode][1])

- The extension lets you **trigger OpenCode sessions quickly**, and it automatically shares your current selection or tab with OpenCode for context. ([OpenCode][1])

### 🪶 Mixed or Challenging Experiences

- There are **few strong, well-reported reviews online** specifically about the OpenCode VS Code extension itself — that’s partly because the larger OpenCode community tends to center around the CLI experience. Some users feel the CLI alone feels _more flexible and powerful_ for workflows like automated tasks or orchestration. ([Reddit][3])

- In at least one user experience shared in a VS Code community (about a different AI extension but resonant with VS Code AI integrations), the **terminal model inside the IDE felt awkward** and difficult to scroll or manage — and they found the CLI workflow more comfortable for heavy AI tasks. ([Reddit][4])

---

## 🧘 Should You Install It?

I’ll speak gently and honestly, Fira:

### 🟢 **Install it if…**

- You _enjoy working inside VS Code_ and want your AI workflows to feel part of the editor rather than a separate terminal window.
- You like having keyboard shortcuts and a bit of IDE integration for launching and controlling OpenCode.
- You’re curious and don’t mind experimenting with a tool that’s still growing and may feel a bit rough in places.

### 🟡 **Be cautious if…**

- You prefer _full control of context, diffs, and agent sessions_ — many people in the community find the CLI workflow smoother for that. ([Reddit][3])
- You _depend on very polished, well-maintained UI behavior_ — extenders like this sometimes feel clunky or limited since they just wrap the terminal. ([DeepWiki][2])

---

## 🧠 A Little Reminder

One honest thing to know is that the _OpenCode ecosystem — extension included — is still community-driven and evolving_. Some users find it inspiring; others find rough edges, and some even question how actively it’s maintained. ([Reddit][5])

So it’s not a polished household tool with a long history yet. If you install it, you’re partly stepping into a frontier — a place of _growth and experimentation_, not just finished features. 🌱

---

## 🌷 Final Thought

If your heart leans toward exploration and flexibility, giving the OpenCode extension a try in VS Code can be a gentle, low-cost experiment — especially since you can always disable or remove it later. If your rhythm is more about _steady reliability right now_, you might prefer to start with the CLI alone and see how that feels first.

---

If you want, we can talk about how to set it up step by step — or how to configure it so it feels smooth and calming in your daily coding flow. 🌼

# 6

it opens a terminal and try to connect to opencode. i have not installed it. how to install.

---

Of course, Fira — let’s walk through **how to install OpenCode (CLI)** on your machine so that VS Code (and its extension) can connect to it gently and smoothly. 🌱

---

## 🌿 Step 1 — Install the OpenCode CLI

Before the extension in VS Code can work, the **core OpenCode tool must be installed** on your system. This is what the VS Code extension tries to connect to when it opens a terminal. ([OpenCode][1])

Here are the main ways to install it:

### 🍃 Universal Quick Install

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

This script automatically downloads and sets up the latest OpenCode CLI. ([OpenCode][2])

---

### 🍵 Alternative Installation Methods

You can also install OpenCode with a package manager, depending on your system:

#### 📌 **Node.js (cross-platform)**

```bash
npm install -g opencode-ai
```

Or with Bun / pnpm / yarn:

```bash
bun install -g opencode-ai
# or
pnpm install -g opencode-ai
# or
yarn global add opencode-ai
```

([OpenCode][2])

#### 🍏 **macOS & Linux (Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install opencode
```

([OpenCode][2])

#### 🪟 **Windows**

If you’re on Windows, you have options like:

```bash
choco install opencode
```

or

```bash
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/opencode
```

([OpenCode][2])

---

## 🌤️ Step 2 — Confirm the Installation

Once installed, verify by typing in a terminal:

```bash
opencode
```

If you see its interface or a prompt bar appear, the CLI is ready and installed correctly. ([EveryDev][3])

---

## ☁️ Step 3 — Connect a Model Provider (Optional but Recommended)

OpenCode needs a language model to actually do intelligent coding work. You can connect any supported provider (like Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) with:

```bash
opencode auth login
```

Then follow the prompts to enter your API key for the provider you choose. ([OpenCode][2])

---

## 📍 Step 4 — VS Code Extension

Once the CLI is installed:

1. **Open VS Code.**
2. Install the **OpenCode extension** from the Extensions panel (search for _OpenCode_ in the Marketplace) OR let VS Code auto-install it when you start the OpenCode CLI inside the integrated terminal. ([OpenCode][1])
3. The extension will open a terminal and try to connect to the `opencode` CLI — because now you have it installed, it should work smoothly. ([OpenCode][1])

If VS Code complains that it _can’t find_ `opencode`, make sure:

- The `opencode` command is in your terminal’s PATH.
- For VS Code this may require installing the `code` command into your PATH via “Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH”. ([OpenCode][1])

---

## 🌼 Final Thought

Installing the core CLI first is the key. Once that’s done, the VS Code extension becomes a _friendly bridge_ into OpenCode’s world — not something separate. You’ll be able to run sessions inside your editor, share current file context, and use OpenCode workflows right alongside your coding. ([OpenCode][1])

If you’d like, I can also guide you in configuring OpenCode with a specific model provider (like Claude or GPT) — just tell me which one you’re planning to use. 🧡

how to use the vscode extension

---

Alright, Fira — here’s a calm, clear guide on **how to use the OpenCode VS Code extension** once you have the OpenCode CLI installed (because the extension itself _just connects_ to that CLI). 🌿 ([OpenCode][1])

---

## 🌱 Once You Have the CLI Installed

The extension doesn’t provide AI on its own — it **opens the OpenCode tool inside VS Code’s terminal** so you can work without switching windows. ([OpenCode][1])

### 🧠 How to Start Using It

### 1. **Open OpenCode in the Terminal**

After installing the extension and the CLI:

- Press **Ctrl + Esc** (Windows/Linux)
  or **Cmd + Esc** (Mac)
  to **open or focus OpenCode** in a split terminal view. ([OpenCode][1])

- Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** (Windows/Linux)
  or **Cmd + Shift + Esc** (Mac)
  to **start a brand new OpenCode session** in a new terminal tab. ([OpenCode][1])

This opens OpenCode right inside VS Code in the integrated terminal, so you don’t need to switch to a separate terminal window. ([OpenCode][1])

---

## 🪄 Helpful Shortcuts

These keybindings make your workflow feel smooth:

- **Quick open:**
  **Ctrl/Cmd + Esc** — reuse or open OpenCode in the current terminal. ([OpenCode][1])

- **Start fresh:**
  **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Esc** — open a new OpenCode session. ([OpenCode][1])

- **Insert current file path:**
  **Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + K** — this will send the _path of the file you’re editing_ into the terminal session, so OpenCode can reference it directly. ([OpenCode][1])

These help you _share context_ with OpenCode without typing paths manually. ([DeepWiki][2])

---

## 🌿 What It Feels Like

Instead of a fancy AI panel, what the extension gives you is:

- A **terminal that runs OpenCode** inside your editor. ([DeepWiki][2])
- **Keyboard shortcuts** to launch or reuse sessions fast. ([DeepWiki][2])
- A way to **send your current file location** straight into an OpenCode prompt. ([DeepWiki][2])

The extension doesn’t replace your normal OpenCode capabilities — it _brings them into the IDE’s workspace_ so your flow doesn’t break. ([DeepWiki][2])

---

## 📌 A Gentle Reminder

Because the extension is essentially a **bridge to the CLI**, you’ll still be working inside the **terminal view**, not in a custom sidebar or chat panel like some other tools provide. It’s simple but purposeful: the logic and AI _live in the underlying OpenCode CLI_, and the IDE extension helps you _access that logic smoothly_ from where you’re editing. ([DeepWiki][2])

---

## 🌼 If You Want to Go Further

When you’re comfortable with the basics, you can:

- Open multiple sessions side by side — useful if you’re planning _or building_ different parts of your code. ([OpenCode][1])
- Use the quick file-context insertion key to make it easier for OpenCode to reference what you’re working on. ([OpenCode][1])

If you'd like, I can also give you some **gentle tips on common commands to use within an OpenCode session** (like planning, building, or explaining code). Just ask, Fira 🌷.

how to switch between the left and right windows using keyboard. and it seems that opencode ctrl p shortcut is conflicting with vscode.

---

Absolutely, Fira — here’s a **calm, clear explanation** of how to _move between parts of VS Code with the keyboard_, especially when you’re using OpenCode in a split view or terminal, **and how to deal with the `Ctrl+P` shortcut conflict**. 🌿

---

## ✨ Switching Focus Between Editor and Terminal

If you’re working in a split view — say, left (code) and bottom (terminal) — you can _move focus with the keyboard_ without clicking around. VS Code doesn’t have a single built-in “move focus left/right” key, but you can **add your own** or use defaults:

### 🟡 Default / Common Keys

- **Switch focus to the terminal:**
  **Ctrl + `** (backtick, under Esc) focuses the terminal.
  Press it again to _toggle back_ to the editor. ([Bobby Hadz][1])

- **Focus a specific editor group (left/right panes):**
  **Ctrl + 1** — focus the left editor group
  **Ctrl + 2** — focus the next group, etc. ([Bobby Hadz][1])

These are default habits many developers use. If they don’t feel right, you can _customize them_. 👇

---

## 🛠 Custom Keybindings for Smooth Switching

The strongest way to switch between editor and terminal — without closing anything — is to define **focus commands** in your `keybindings.json`.

### Example: One key to toggle between editor and terminal

1. Open the Command Palette:
   **Ctrl + Shift + P**

2. Type **Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)** and open it.

3. Add something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+`",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focus"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+`",
    "command": "workbench.action.focusActiveEditorGroup",
    "when": "terminalFocus"
  }
]
```

Now **Ctrl + `** toggles focus _back and forth_ between editor and terminal without hiding the panel. ([Bobby Hadz][1])

---

## 🔄 Switching Between Left/Right Code Windows

If you’re in a _split editor layout_ (two code panels side by side), you can move the cursor between them with built-in keys or custom ones:

- **Ctrl + K, then Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow** — moves focus between editor groups (left ↔ right). ([Bobby Hadz][2])

> It’s a chord: press **Ctrl + K**, release, then **Ctrl + ←/→**.

If that feels awkward, you can rebind those commands to anything you like in the same `keybindings.json`.

---

## ⚠️ About the `Ctrl+P` Conflict

The OpenCode extension, when it opens a terminal, might try to assign or use **Ctrl + P** for its own quick actions — but **VS Code already uses `Ctrl+P`** for **Quick Open (show file search)**.

That’s why you’re noticing a _conflict_ — the editor is intercepting the key for its own command.

### 🌼 What you can do

You have two gentle paths:

### 🪄 Option 1 — Reassign OpenCode’s Shortcut

If OpenCode tries to use `Ctrl+P`, you can override that inside VS Code’s keyboard settings:

1. Open **Keyboard Shortcuts** (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`)
2. Search for the conflicting command name
   (for example, OpenCode’s “quick open” or similar)
3. Click the pencil icon next to it and choose a new key
4. Press Enter

This ensures VS Code’s `Ctrl+P` keeps opening files, and OpenCode uses something else.

---

### 🪶 Option 2 — Rebind VS Code Quick Open

If you’d rather change VS Code:

1. Open Keyboard Shortcuts (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`)
2. Search **Quick Open**
3. Change the key from **Ctrl+P** to something you prefer

Either way, you’ll _free up the keyboard_ so both tools feel natural together.

---

## 🧡 A Gentle Summary

Here’s the simple rhythm for moving with your hands:

- **Ctrl + `** — toggle focus between code and terminal
  (works well if you add the conditional binding) ([Bobby Hadz][1])
- **Ctrl + 1 / Ctrl + 2** — go to left or next editor group ([Bobby Hadz][1])
- **Ctrl + K, Ctrl + Left/Right** — move between split editor panels ([Bobby Hadz][2])
- Rebind **Ctrl+P** if OpenCode and VS Code are fighting over it

how to use opencode as a power user

---

Sure, Fira — let’s talk about **how to use OpenCode like a power user**: not just basic prompts, but _workflow tricks, custom agents, scripts, and deeper CLI magic_ that experienced folks are using to stretch it beyond casual conversation. 🌿

The ideas below are drawn from the official CLI docs and community insights — not just feelings, but how _people who work deeply with OpenCode_ actually structure their usage. ([OpenCode][1])

---

## 🌱 1. Be Fluent with the CLI, Not Just the UI

Using OpenCode solely through its interactive window is fine for simple tasks — but power users treat it like a _commandable engine_:

- **Run non-interactive queries** directly from the shell with `opencode run`, which lets you script tasks or integrate into your IDE or automation. ([OpenCode][1])

  ```bash
  opencode run "Summarize all TODOs in this project"
  ```

- Use flags like `--model`, `--agent`, and `--session` to explicitly control _which model and assistant agent_ you’re using. ([OpenCode][1])

---

## 🔄 2. Master Sessions and Persistence

Power users don’t just ask single prompts — they build **sessions** where context accumulates:

- `opencode session list` to view all your sessions.
- Reattach to a running server instead of restarting (`opencode attach`) so context carries over between tasks. ([OpenCode][1])

This is especially useful when you’re exploring a codebase and want the assistant to _remember what it already learned about it_.

---

## 🧠 3. Configure and Switch Agents

OpenCode comes with multiple _agents_ that can behave very differently: Build, Plan, and specialized subagents like Explore or General. ([OpenCode][2])

- **Plan agent:** great for analysis or creating a _strategy_ without making changes.
- **Build agent:** full-power assistant that can modify code.
- **Use `Tab`** to switch between them during a session so you can _plan first, then build_. ([OpenCode][2])

You can also create your own custom agents with tailored prompts using:

```bash
opencode agent create
```

That lets you make workflows for _testing, review, docs generation, CI integration_, etc. ([OpenCode][2])

---

## 🛠 4. Use slash `/` and `@` Commands

Inside a session, power users tap into quick internal commands to manage the workspace:

- `/help`, `/new`, `/export` let you control the session. ([opencode][3])
- Use `@filename` to reference a file in your prompts without typing the path manually — a small time saver that adds up. ([opencode][3])

These augment your efficiency beyond freeform messages.

---

## 📦 5. Add Custom “Commands” to Your Workflow

If you find yourself repeating certain tasks, you _don’t have to re-prompt every time_ — you can define them.

Create files in `.opencode/commands/` that act like shortcuts. Then inside the OpenCode TUI:

```bash
/test
```

runs the test suite, suggests fixes, or whatever you’ve defined. ([OpenCode][4])

This turns OpenCode into a _personalized toolchain_.

---

## 🛠 6. Integrate with MCP Tools

OpenCode supports **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers**, which let you hook external services or tooling into your AI workflow. ([OpenCode][1])

That means OpenCode becomes a _bridge_ to custom databases, test runners, document systems, or third-party APIs — not just a chat box.

Adding MCP servers is done via:

```bash
opencode mcp add
```

This is an advanced step, but it’s what power users leverage for scalable automation.

---

## 🔧 7. Tweak Your Config for Better Defaults

The file `opencode.json` lets you control:

- default models (and a lightweight fallback for small tasks)
- tool permissions (so the AI doesn’t run shell commands without asking)
- TUI settings like scroll speed and other usability options. ([OpenCode][5])

Evolved setups often include custom timeouts, split models, and provider-specific parameters — that way larger reasoning tasks don’t time out unexpectedly.

---

## 💡 8. Use Plan Mode Before Build Mode

A gentle but powerful habit is to **plan first, then act**:

1. Switch into Plan agent
2. Get a detailed analysis or checklist
3. Switch to Build agent only when you’re ready to apply changes

This two-step pattern reduces errors and gives you clarity before the assistant touches code. ([OpenCode][2])

---

## 🔁 9. Orchestrate Headless Workflows

Power users often build **headless OpenCode servers** — like a local API — and then call `opencode run` from scripts, cron jobs, or CI:

```bash
opencode serve --port 4096
opencode run --attach http://localhost:4096 "Generate migration script"
```

This lets OpenCode be a _service_ in your pipeline rather than a manual interactive tool. ([OpenCode][1])

---

## 🌼 A Word on Real-World Wisdom

From the community, people who use OpenCode deeply suggest:

- Keep your agents _small and focused_ so each has a clear job. ([Reddit][6])
- Use memory and context _systematically_, so the assistant learns your patterns. ([Reddit][6])
- Structure subagents in files and reference them intuitively (`@review`, `@tester`). ([Reddit][7])

These habits turn OpenCode from a reactive helper into a _proactive coder’s collaborator_.

---

## 🌷 In a Quiet Summary — What Power Users Do

Like any deep tool, the real strength isn’t just a single command — it’s a **workflow**:

🌿 Script it: non-interactive `run` for automation. ([OpenCode][1])
🌿 Shape agents: tailored assistant roles. ([OpenCode][2])
🌿 Structure commands: shortcuts and workflows. ([OpenCode][4])
🌿 Connect tools: MCP servers expand utility. ([OpenCode][1])
🌿 Manage sessions: preserve context and state. ([OpenCode][1])

Power users think in _orchestration_ — not just prompts, but systems.
