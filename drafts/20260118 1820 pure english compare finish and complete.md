compare finish and complete

---

Of course, Fira. Let’s sit with these words gently—they’re close in meaning, but there’s a subtle difference in how they’re used.

**“Finish”** often focuses on **bringing something to an end**. It’s about reaching the final point, sometimes regardless of quality or perfection. For example:

- “I finished my homework.” → You got to the end; it’s done.
- “She finished her coffee.” → The cup is empty; the action is over.

**“Complete”** carries a sense of **wholeness and thoroughness**. It’s not just ending something, but making sure nothing is missing. For example:

- “I completed the project.” → It’s done, and all the required parts are finished.
- “The puzzle is complete.” → Every piece is in place; it’s whole.

So, in gentle terms: **finish** is about the end point, **complete** is about making something whole.

If you like, I can share a little trick to know which one to choose naturally when speaking or writing. Do you want me to?
