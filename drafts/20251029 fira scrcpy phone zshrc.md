ive defined a fn called phone in zshrc. how to run it elsewhere

---

To run your `phone` function defined in `.zshrc` in other contexts, here are the methods depending on your use case:

### 1. **Current Shell Session**

If you've just edited `~/.zshrc`, reload it in your current shell:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then call the function directly:

```zsh
phone
```

---

### 2. **Subshells or Scripts**

If you want to use the function in a **subshell** (e.g., scripts, one-off commands), explicitly source `.zshrc`:

```zsh
zsh -c 'source ~/.zshrc; phone'
```

---

### 3. **Permanently Available in All Sessions**

Ensure your `.zshrc` is loaded automatically:

- Restart your terminal or open a new tab/window.
- The function will be available in all new interactive shells.

---

### 4. **Use in Non-Interactive Scripts**

For scripts that run in **non-interactive shells** (e.g., `#!/bin/zsh` scripts), add this at the top:

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh
source ~/.zshrc
phone  # Now the function is available
```

---

### 5. **Debugging Tips**

- Check if the function is loaded:
  ```zsh
  type phone
  ```
- Verify `.zshrc` is sourced correctly:
  ```zsh
  echo $ZDOTDIR  # Ensure it points to where your .zshrc lives
  ```

---

### Key Notes:

- Functions in `.zshrc` are only available in **interactive shells** by default.
- Use `source ~/.zshrc` to manually reload changes.
- For scripts, explicitly source `.zshrc` to access the function.

Let me know if you need further clarification!
