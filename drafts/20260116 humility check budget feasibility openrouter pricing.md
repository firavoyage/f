How much is the rate limit of free models on openrouter

---

Fira, let’s speak gently about the _rate limits_ you asked about for **OpenRouter’s free tier** — in simple, clear terms 🌿

### 🌱 If you’re just starting with free models

When you use **free models on OpenRouter** — usually those whose names end with `:free` — there are two key limits:

**• Daily calls (free without payment):** about **50 requests per day**.
**• Requests per minute:** about **20 requests per minute**.
These limits mean you can make up to ~20 quick calls in a minute, and up to ~50 in a whole day if you haven’t added credits. ([OpenRouter][1])

### 🍃 If you add some credits

If you **add at least $10 worth of credits** to your OpenRouter account — even once — the daily cap for free models increases to **about 1,000 requests per day**.
The same per‑minute limit (20/min) still applies. ([OpenRouter][1])

### 💡 What that feels like

Imagine you’re building a small app or testing ideas:

- With just the free tier, you can explore gently, but you’ll reach your limit soon.
- With a small deposit ($10), you get a much bigger daily window — a kind of breathing room to experiment. ([OpenRouter][2])

That’s the quiet rhythm of the limits — slow and steady. If you’d like, I can walk you through some strategies to work thoughtfully within these boundaries. 💫

I have paid 10. What do people say.

---

Fira, let’s sit with what people are _actually saying_ after they’ve put that gentle $10 into OpenRouter — _not just the official numbers, but the lived experiences from the community_ 🌿

### 💬 What the rules _are_

First, the basics are solid:
If your account balance stays **above $10**, your daily free model allowance rises to about **1,000 calls a day**, with a 20/minute throttle too. ([OpenRouter][1])

So on paper — that’s a generous, warm space to explore.

---

### 🧠 What people _actually feel and share_

But here’s the human side of it — honest, mixed, and grounded:

🌦 **Some folks feel it’s worth it.**
On Reddit, several people noted that after topping up, they didn’t see their $10 _actually get consumed_ by using free models — their balance stayed above the threshold, and they felt comfortable they could keep up to 1,000 attempts per day. ([Reddit][2])

They also expressed the sense that you _don’t lose credits simply by keeping them topped up_, as long as you stick with the free model variants and don’t use paid ones. ([Reddit][3])

🪶 **Others found reality less smooth.**
There are posts from people saying that even after paying, they ran into **frequent “rate limited” errors** — sometimes within minutes — and it felt like the system wasn’t honoring that higher daily quota. ([Reddit][4])

Some said the free models themselves are unstable or hard to access at times, with errors like _429 (Too Many Requests)_ showing up a lot, even when the credit balance should give room. ([Trustpilot][5])

🧪 **And some noticed quirks.**
A few have reported that on different accounts the number of usable calls before hitting limits varied, as though the experience wasn’t always uniform. ([Reddit][6])

---

### 🍃 So what does all this _really_ mean?

In steady words, Fira:

- The **policy** is clear and generous: $10 opens up space for ~1,000 possible uses per day. ([OpenRouter][1])
- But the **experience** isn’t always smooth — there can be throttling or errors that feel like limits even when you _should_ have room. ([Reddit][4])
- Many of the frustrations come from _how the free models are served and prioritized_, not the $10 credit itself.

Some people use that $10 gently and find it enough for experimentation. Others bump up against downtime, backend quirks, or availability issues and feel it’s not as reliable as they hoped.

If you’re seeking calm clarity — it’s like having a breeze that _should_ be supportive, but sometimes gusts unpredictably 🌬️

---

If you want, we can talk about **how to make the most of it** — maybe how to design prompts or workflows that are kind to those limits, so your $10 feels like a slow, steady companion rather than a sprint. 💛

Should I make the balance stay above 10 or just once

---

Fira, let’s gently clarify the _practical rule_ about that $10 you added — with both the official docs and what people in the community say 🌿

### 🌼 What the official documentation says

Once you **buy at least $10 in credits**, OpenRouter raises your **free‑model rate limit** from ~50 uses a day to **about 1,000 uses per day** for those `:free` models. Importantly, this **upgrade isn’t tied to keeping the balance above $10** forever — it’s about having _purchased_ at least $10 at some point. So even if your balance goes below $10 later, you still keep the higher daily quota. ([OpenRouter][1])

### 🌼 What actual users say

People on Reddit who have watched this closely generally agree:

- You **don’t need to keep your balance above $10 every day** to keep the bigger daily free quota — once it “unlocks,” it tends to stay unlocked. ([Reddit][2])
- You just need to _reach_ that $10 total deposited, even in smaller chunks over time, to qualify for the higher limit. ([Reddit][3])
- Some users confirm that the increased quota still works even if the current balance falls below $10 later. ([Reddit][4])

### 🌱 A gentle note about how it feels

Imagine the $10 payment as unlocking a door — it doesn’t **require you to stand in the doorway forever**. Once open, you can walk through each day up to your 1,000 uses of free models.

But there’s a quiet caveat:
Even with the higher quota, the _free models themselves can be unstable_ or have their own throttles (404/429 errors can appear), because the underlying providers may slow things down or prioritize other traffic. So it can feel like a limit even when the system says you still have room. ([Robo Rhythms][5])

### 🌸 In plain terms, Fira

- **You only need to hit $10 once** to unlock the bigger daily free allowance.
- **You don’t need to keep your balance above $10 every day.**
- Your _actual experience_ might still vary because the free models aren’t always reliable, but the rate‑limit upgrade stays with your account. ([OpenRouter][1])

If you want, we can talk about how to check your current quota or how to avoid accidentally spending credits on paid models.
