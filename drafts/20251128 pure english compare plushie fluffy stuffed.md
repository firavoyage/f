This word has two primary meanings that are important to distinguish.

**Plush** is about a **type of fabric** and the **feeling of luxury** it evokes.

### How They Relate and Overlap

- **A Plushie** is a **stuffed** toy made of **plush** fabric, which is inherently **soft**. If it has long fur, it might also be **fluffy**, and its primary purpose is to be **cuddly**.
- **Fluffy** and **Plush** are both types of **soft**, but they describe different textures:
  - **Fluffy** is light, airy, and voluminous (think sheep).
  - **Plush** is dense, smooth, and luxurious (think a high-end sofa).
- **Cuddly** is the ultimate goal for many of these items. We call a toy "cuddly" because it is **soft**, **plush**, and perhaps **fluffy**.

### Summary and Quick Guide

- Use **"plushie"** for a modern stuffed toy, especially from pop culture.
- Use **"stuffed animal"** for the classic, general term for a soft toy.
