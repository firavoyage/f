Inspiration: why might maimai players die soon. Investigate, find patterns: eat sugar, eat salt, eat mushrooms, mental.

opencode

export sucks. wrong markdown code blocks. (3 or 4 backticks, some are not in pairs)

---

pros love

- verbose english
- scalable tools for simple things
- showmanship: shiny landing pages, build in public (meaningless updates on twitter)

---

Gboard voice input

grow (all):

non trival otaku/geek/nerd porn.

ordinary girls dance and impress sex with nothing deep. philistine.

- a girl looking outside the window (the low opacity image): sorrow, melachony, loss.
- an energetic girl wearing political green uniform: weird, sarcastic
- ...

my projects are easy... so humility could solve. without big companies like cursor and claude...

that said... it could be valuable

- elegant
- pure

e.g. i think there are many people surfing twitter/hn directly these days.

i could remove friction. "journey of thinking"

e.g. remove

- not honest
- version releases
- low society
- out of scarcity (promo: low pricing, free credits, gift codes. running out)

e.g.

"make people daily honest" -> boom

_revise projects._

make ctrl c -> copy markdown

"pref/cfg/settings"

(lichess uses preferences)

... the board ui is not in pref...

under user. stupid. at least weird.

(an user could get to a place with any route)

(inspired by funshiki: 星塔旅人, yostar's new game, 2.5d genshin impact.)

fatefairy:

- hex(8964): drive tank. when hitting the innocent increase the speed. when approaching near the happy few (those with power) die immediately. once it kill some innocent the tank wont be able to stop.
- hex(20105): grow, swap. like poison. the ground with higher number is more toxic. it will do the math and act wisely but it could not know the state of current arena.

之前做 i18n 的时候顺手做了一个 “喵呜中文”，npy 说主题设置可以叫 “光线：自然光/开灯/关灯”，感觉超贴切。可惜实在没有精力编那么多可爱文案，最后也没有上正式版 …

？笑死我了这是 Kimi APP 的主题切换
怎么把月之暗面和月之亮面写这里来了
