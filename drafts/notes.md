How to know what are hype, what are long term value. Different or wrong.

---

Inspiration: why might maimai players die soon. Investigate, find patterns: eat sugar, eat salt, eat mushrooms, mental.

---

opencode

export sucks. wrong markdown code blocks. (3 or 4 backticks, some are not in pairs)

---

pros love

- verbose english
- scalable tools for simple things
- showmanship: shiny landing pages, build in public (meaningless updates on twitter)

---

Gboard voice input

---

grow (all):

non trival otaku/geek/nerd porn.

ordinary girls dance and impress sex with nothing deep. philistine.

- a girl looking outside the window (the low opacity image): sorrow, melachony, loss.
- an energetic girl wearing political green uniform: weird, sarcastic
- ...

---

Ctrl r and para. Instead of Ctrl shift v.

---

my projects are easy... so humility could solve. without big companies like cursor and claude...

that said... it could be valuable

- elegant
- pure

e.g. i think there are many people surfing twitter/hn directly these days.

i could remove friction. "journey of thinking"

e.g. remove

- not honest
- version releases
- low society
- out of scarcity (promo: low pricing, free credits, gift codes. running out)

e.g.

"make people daily honest" -> boom

---

_revise projects._

make ctrl c -> copy markdown

---

"pref/cfg/settings"

(lichess uses preferences)

... the board ui is not in pref...

under user. stupid. at least weird.

(an user could get to a place with any route)

8 mins read.

you should know this on top of an article on twitter.

(inspired by funshiki: 星塔旅人, yostar's new game, 2.5d genshin impact.)

fatefairy:

- hex(8964): drive tank. when hitting the innocent increase the speed. when approaching near the happy few (those with power) die immediately. once it kill some innocent the tank wont be able to stop.
- hex(20105): grow, swap. like poison. the ground with higher number is more toxic. it will do the math and act wisely but it could not know the state of current arena.

之前做 i18n 的时候顺手做了一个 “喵呜中文”，npy 说主题设置可以叫 “光线：自然光/开灯/关灯”，感觉超贴切。可惜实在没有精力编那么多可爱文案，最后也没有上正式版 …

？笑死我了这是 Kimi APP 的主题切换
怎么把月之暗面和月之亮面写这里来了

---

"all good solutions come from a complex yet well defined problem"

---

windows is pragmatic. mac is beautiful. linux is free.

---

Docs. Guide. Ref. Spec.

---

pure math.

Lucky. Unlucky. Lucky enough.

---

Combine browser and os. A tab page and an app window are the same thing.

---

Grow: podcast.

Take a note or quote at the current time.

---

abstraction on react, svelte, etc.

Component have state and effects. Props are to compute the initial state. Where to store state doesn't matter. Reducer is abstraction.

Js preprocessor is abstraction.

---

All: phones.

Stats. Feeling of stats. UI. Look of ui. Reports. Issues. Posts. Comments.

Buying a headphone. The search page is very unclear. Popularity. Promo. Ads on the product picture. I could only decide with brand and price. Pick Sony.

---

Grow: human index.

Some ppl appear a lot. Luban today. Who once comment on my place. Zhihu is small. The world is small.

---

Bird: settings.

Date and time fmt. No link preview by default.

---

Lichess app still sucks. You couldn't view puzzle solutions. They just don't display. And idk whether the promotion issue is fixed.

---

bird.

On telegram you could create link previews. You could move up, enlarge/shrink photo, and apply changes. But you could not just disable by default. At least I don't see it when sending messages.

Btw, I don't think there should be apply changes. Such button should only exist in professional softwares for irreversible actions.

It seems that there exists such an option. But doesn't work. Maybe only apply to secret chats.

On bird you could swipe the top bar to switch chats. You can pull down to view all maybe. On the bottom of a chat you swipe down to the next unread chat, maybe you could disable this.

Avatar. Name. Msg Lr Alignment. You could choose whether to show.

Use verbs. Instead of a list. See news. Check the status of friends. Chat. They are different. Not inside the same list.

---

Progressive disclosure.

Progressive enhancement.

Minimal viable step.

---

I suddenly recall this.

Declarative > Imperative

Explicit > Implicit

Oop is on top of fp. As a syntax sugar it's good. As an abstraction it could be redundant. Fp is the essence.

---

On Firefox Android.

Desktop mode off on is friction.

Checkbox is clear.

---

Podcast: record all activities, actions. What have you jumped.

---

you can use claude theme... (shadcn/ui?)

while you can also use atoms.jamesclear.com

---

stripe ui is good.

---

pure math.

If a fn is always down, it might not be negative one day. If a fn is always down at least c every delta x, it would.

---

all: interests/subreddits.

not finding the list on the first page of search "reddit interests" "reddit onboarding interests". rather save it here.
