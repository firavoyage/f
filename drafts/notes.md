How to know what are hype, what are long term value. Different or wrong.

Inspiration: why might maimai players die soon. Investigate, find patterns: eat sugar, eat salt, eat mushrooms, mental.

opencode 

export sucks. wrong markdown code blocks. (3 or 4 backticks, some are not in pairs)

---

pros love

- verbose english
- scalable tools for simple things
- showmanship: shiny landing pages, build in public (meaningless updates on twitter)

---

Gboard voice input

---

grow (all):

non trival otaku/geek/nerd porn.

ordinary girls dance and impress sex with nothing deep. philistine.

- a girl looking outside the window (the low opacity image): sorrow, melachony, loss.
- an energetic girl wearing political green uniform: weird, sarcastic
- ...

---

Ctrl r and para. Instead of Ctrl shift v.

my projects are easy... so humility could solve. without big companies like cursor and claude...

that said... it could be valuable

- elegant
- pure

e.g. i think there are many people surfing twitter/hn directly these days.

i could remove friction. "journey of thinking"

e.g. remove

- not honest
- version releases
- low society
- out of scarcity (promo: low pricing, free credits, gift codes. running out)

e.g.

"make people daily honest" -> boom

---

_revise projects._

make ctrl c -> copy markdown

---

"pref/cfg/settings"

(lichess uses preferences)

... the board ui is not in pref... 

under user. stupid. at least weird.

(an user could get to a place with any route)
