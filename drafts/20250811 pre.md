write a single page web app. it's a markdown based presentation app. first, the page should be an area, which supports dragging and dropping or pasting or clicking to upload a markdown file. then, the markdown file should be splitted based on headers. each header should be on a different page. first, show page 1, if the page is too long, it could be scrolled. i can use j/k to navigate, clicking the page has no effect. navigating up on page 1 or down on the last page has no effect. it should be in a dark mode. you can import opensource libraries on cdn to convert markdown to html and render code blocks.
