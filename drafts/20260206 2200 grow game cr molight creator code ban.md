why is mohamad light banned

---

It sounds like what you’re asking about is a **Clash Royale content creator named Mohamed (or Mohammad) Light** who got **banned or had his creator code suspended** on that platform.

From community chatter and posts around the gaming world, it seems his ban isn’t because of anything like religious or political reasons — it’s about things said and how the platform reacted to them. Some players in the community point to comments he made on stream where he said something extreme about the game’s development team (for example, that they _“should be shot”_ — a phrase that sounds like anger and exaggeration, but which is taken seriously by platforms because of rules around threats and safety). Those kinds of statements often go against the rules content platforms set to keep spaces safe, so the company may have suspended or removed his creator privileges for violating those rules. ([Reddit][1])

In other words, it isn’t about who he is or what he believes in general — it seems tied to **how he expressed frustration**, and how the game’s creators or moderators enforce their policies when someone in their official creator program crosses a line. ([Reddit][1])

deep dive.

---

Here’s a clear, thoughtful picture of what’s been happening with **Mohamed Light** and why many people are talking about his _creator code_ being removed — they’re not talking about a “ban” from the game itself, but a loss of a special in-game promotion feature.

Mohamed Light is a **top-tier Clash Royale player**, one of the most successful and famous competitors in the world. He’s been **world champion multiple times**, and his skill is undeniable in the esports scene. ([behindzgames.com][1])

But recently, something unusual happened: his **creator code in Clash Royale was revoked by Supercell**. That means people can’t use “molight” in the in-game creator support system anymore, and he no longer gets that official support recognition. ([Vortex Gaming][2])

Here’s what seems to be at the heart of it:

• Over the last couple of months he made **strong, direct public criticisms of the game’s balance team and some design choices** — especially complaints about how recent changes have affected the game. His remarks were more intense and blunt than usual for a public figure in the community. ([Vortex Gaming][2])

• Clips of those comments spread around online and in the Clash community, and Supercell appears to have **decided that his public comments crossed a line for someone in the official creator program**. According to community-shared reporting, that led to the removal of his creator code on **January 5, 2026**. ([Vortex Gaming][2])

• People in the Clash Royale community have been talking about it on Reddit and other forums — some defending him, others saying the company has a right to enforce its standards, even if he’s one of the biggest figures in the game. ([Reddit][3])

Even though wise, deep criticism can be valuable, game companies and platforms often treat **public commentary from official ambassadors differently** than general player opinions. When someone with visibility speaks strongly about development teams or design choices, it can affect how the company chooses to work with them going forward — even if it doesn’t stop them from playing or competing. ([Vortex Gaming][2])

This isn’t really about **being banned from Clash Royale** itself, but about losing a specific _creator support feature_ because of the tone and visibility of his comments about the game. ([Vortex Gaming][2])

be simple.

---

Fira, the situation is simpler than it looks:

**Mohamed Light hasn’t been banned from Clash Royale itself.** He’s still playing. What changed is that **his official _creator code_ was removed by Supercell** — people can no longer use his code in the in-game support system. ([Vortex Gaming][1])

That happened because in a recent **live stream he criticized the game developers and balance team very strongly** — the tone and words were intense enough that Supercell appears to have decided he no longer fit their creator program. ([Vortex Gaming][1])

This **isn’t a game ban** where his account is blocked or he can’t play. It’s specifically about losing that _creator code_ status, which is part of how Supercell officially supports certain players and content creators. ([skycoach.gg][2])

So he’s not banned from the game world — just removed from that promotion/support feature. ([Vortex Gaming][1])

what does he say

---

Here’s the **simple heart of what people say Mohamed Light actually _said_ that stirred this whole situation**, Fira:

On a recent **live stream**, he spoke **very strongly about the game’s balance team and how he feels the game is broken or unfair**. People in the community pointed out that he was frustrated and said things that **came off as more than just a casual complaint**, including **very blunt criticism about the developers and the way certain cards or balance decisions were handled**. Because he has a _creator code_ and represents part of the community in an official way, those comments were seen as crossing a line with Supercell. ([Reddit][1])

The Reddit posts people share say something like:

> “few days ago mo talked about that broken cards and balancing team and now supercell removed his creator code.” ([Reddit][1])

They don’t quote exact sentences in the post, but the gist is that his **tone was harsh and very direct in criticizing the developers and the balance system** — stronger than most creators usually stay. ([Reddit][1])

So what _he said_ wasn’t just “I don’t like the update.” It was **public, intense criticism of game balance and the team behind it**, and that’s what people think led Supercell to remove his official creator status. ([Reddit][1])

find the quote

---

I found **one community quote that points to exactly what he said**, Fira:

Some Reddit users reported that his creator code was removed **because he said something like the _balancing team should be shot in the head_** — that phrase appears in comments people were sharing about the controversy. That’s not an official quote from Supercell but it \*is what community posts are quoting as the specific thing he said that upset people. ([Reddit][1])

Here’s how they wrote it:

> “for saying the balancing team _should be shot in the head_” ([Reddit][1])

That’s the clearest wording people online have used in describing the remarks that led to his _creator code_ being removed.

I couldn’t find a **verified, verbatim quote directly from his livestream or an official transcript**, but this is the content that’s been circulating as the reason many think Supercell took action. ([Reddit][1])
