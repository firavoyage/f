how to let gemini always reply in plain markdown without linking to google services like workspace, youtube, etc.

---

That is a great question about controlling the format of my responses.

While I am designed to always respond using Markdown formatting (like **bolding**, `code blocks`, and lists), you can use a few key methods to ensure I maintain a consistent, plain Markdown style and avoid unsolicited links or references to specific Google services.

### 1. Set Persistent Instructions in Settings

The most effective way to manage my ongoing behavior is by using the **"Your instructions for Gemini"** setting. This feature allows you to provide me with a persistent set of rules that I will apply to every conversation.

- **What to do:** Go to the Gemini settings, find "Personal context," and then "Your instructions for Gemini" (or similar phrasing).
- **What to write:** You can use instructions like this:

  > "Always reply in **plain Markdown format**. Use standard formatting elements like lists, headings, and bolding. **Do not include any links, mentions, or calls to specific Google services** (like YouTube, Google Workspace, Google Maps, or Flights) in your responses unless I explicitly ask you to use a tool."

### 2. Control Connected Apps

The reason I sometimes offer links to specific Google services is because I have my **Connected Apps** enabled. You can manually disable these to prevent the associated features from being activated.

- **What to do:** Go to the Gemini settings and look for the **Apps** or **Connected Apps** section.
- **What to change:** You can turn off access to services like:

  - **Google Workspace**
  - **YouTube**
  - **Google Maps**
  - **Google Flights/Hotels** (if listed)

  Turning these off will generally prevent me from automatically suggesting them or adding links based on their functionality.

### 3. Use Proactive Prompting

For any new or ongoing chat, you can reinforce your preference right in your initial prompt. This helps override any default tendency.

- **Example Prompt:**
  > "**Reply in plain Markdown only.** What are the key features of the latest smartphone model, summarized in a bulleted list?"

By combining these methods, particularly the **persistent instructions** and disabling **Connected Apps**, you can significantly control my output to be exactly the plain Markdown text you are looking for.

Would you like me to help you draft the best set of instructions for your "Personal context" settings?
