naming things, what do nouns and verbs feel

---

That’s a lovely question, Fira.
It feels like you’re asking about _sense_, not grammar.

A **noun** feels like a _resting place_.
It’s something you can pause with.
A thing, a name, a shape in the mind.
Even abstract nouns—_love, silence, fear_—feel like something you can gently hold.

A **verb** feels like _breath or movement_.
It’s never still.
It leans forward.
To _run_, to _become_, to _listen_—verbs feel alive because they are always happening, even when they describe stillness.

If nouns are stones in a river,
verbs are the water moving around them.

Nouns answer: _What is here?_
Verbs answer: _What is changing?_

And naming itself sits between them.
When you name a thing, you turn motion into rest.
When you use a verb, you remind the world that nothing truly stays still.

We often need both to feel whole:
something to stand on,
and something to carry us forward.

What made you wonder about this?

like in swe, naming folders, nouns like integration, database, and core, and verbs like connect, store, and compute

---

Ah, I see what you’re touching, Fira.
This is a _felt_ question about structure, not just words.

In software, **nouns** feel like _rooms_.
They are places where things live.

- **database** feels like a vault — memory, weight, permanence
- **integration** feels like a bridge that has already been built
- **core** feels like a center, something you protect and rarely disturb

Noun-folders say: _“This exists. It stays.”_
They give a system gravity.

**Verbs**, in contrast, feel like _hallways and doors_.
They describe what moves through the system.

- **connect** feels like reaching outward
- **store** feels like placing something down carefully
- **compute** feels like effort, heat, transformation

Verb-folders say: _“This happens. This flows.”_
They give a system life.

There’s also a quiet design truth here:
folders named with nouns tend to age well.
Folders named with verbs tend to change as behavior changes.

That’s not a rule — just a feeling many systems reveal over time.

A gentle balance often works best:

- nouns for _domains and boundaries_
- verbs for _pipelines, actions, and temporary paths_

When naming folders, you’re really answering one question:

> “Is this a **place**, or is this a **movement**?”

If you’d like, you can share a few real folder names you’re unsure about,
and we can listen to what they _want_ to be together.

like in swe, naming folders, integration/connect, database/store, core/compute, etc.

---

Ah. That helps, Fira.
You’re talking about _software_, but you’re really talking about _orientation_.

In SWE, names aren’t labels.
They’re quiet promises about how the system wants to be understood.

Here’s the gentle pattern many good systems follow:

**Nouns** in folders feel like _places_.
They say: “This is where things live.”

- `database`, `store`, `cache` → _memory_
- `core`, `domain`, `model` → _identity_
- `config`, `schema` → _structure_

When you open a noun-named folder, your mind relaxes.
You’re not expecting motion.
You’re expecting _context_.

**Verbs** feel like _paths_.
They say: “This is where things happen.”

- `integrate`, `connect`, `sync`
- `compute`, `process`, `transform`
- `validate`, `resolve`

Verb folders create direction.
They imply flow, cause, consequence.

So a quiet rule emerges:

- **Nouns = stable centers**
- **Verbs = edges and bridges**

A system feels calm when its **core is noun-shaped**
and its **boundaries are verb-shaped**.

That’s why:

- `core` feels right as a noun
- `compute` feels right as a verb
- `integration` (a noun) feels like a _zone_
- `connect` (a verb) feels like an _action_

You can even feel the difference in your body:

- Noun folders invite you to _stay_
- Verb folders invite you to _move_

When naming feels hard, it’s often because the thing itself is undecided:
Is this a _place_ or a _journey_?

A small guiding question I use:

> “Would I expect this to change often, or to anchor other things?”

If it anchors → noun.
If it flows → verb.

If you want, we can look at one of your actual folder names and listen to what it wants to be.

naming folders, what do nouns and verbs feel

---

That’s a thoughtful question, Fira.

When you name folders, **nouns and verbs carry very different feelings**, almost like different ways of breathing.

**Nouns feel like places.**
They are still. Solid. Containing.
A noun folder says, _“Things live here.”_
It feels safe, archival, and grounded.

Examples in feeling, not function:

- _Projects_ — a room with labeled shelves
- _Photos_ — a quiet box of memories
- _Ideas_ — a drawer you can open later

Nouns are good when you want **clarity, stability, and retrieval**.

---

**Verbs feel like motion.**
They imply action, direction, becoming.
A verb folder says, _“Things are happening here.”_
It feels alive, unfinished, forward-moving.

Examples in feeling:

- _Write_ — an open desk with a notebook
- _Build_ — tools mid-use
- _Review_ — something asking for attention

Verbs are good when you want **momentum, intention, and flow**.

---

A gentle rule many people feel without naming it:

- Use **nouns** for long-term storage and identity
- Use **verbs** for short-term focus and active work

Some systems even mix them:

- A noun at the top (_Projects_)
- Verbs inside (_Drafting_, _Revising_, _Shipping_)

If you notice what your folders _feel like_ when you open them—quiet rooms or active workbenches—you’ll know which language you need right now.

If you’d like, tell me what kind of space you’re trying to create, and we can name it together.
