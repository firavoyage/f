how would you like to translate "炭烤焦香肉骨串" in english

---

Of course! This is a great name for a dish, as it contains several enticing elements. A good translation should capture the essence, not just the literal words.

Here are several options, from best and most common to more literal.

### Top Recommendations:

**1. Char-Grilled Bone-In Meat Skewers**

- **Why it works:** This is the most natural and appetizing translation for a menu.
  - **Char-Grilled** perfectly captures "炭烤" (charcoal-grilled) and hints at the "焦香" (charred aroma).
  - **Bone-In** is the standard culinary term for "肉骨" (meat with bone).
  - **Skewers** is the clear translation for "串".

**2. Charcoal-Grilled Skewers with Charred Aroma**

- **Why it works:** This one explicitly mentions the "charred aroma" ("焦香"), which is a key selling point. It's very descriptive and mouth-watering.

**3. Charred and Aromatic Bone-In Skewers**

- **Why it works:** This is a concise and elegant option that focuses on the sensory experience ("Charred and Aromatic") rather than the cooking method.

### More Literal or Descriptive Options:

- **Charcoal-Grilled Bone-In Meat Skewers with a Smoky Char:** Very descriptive, but a bit long for a menu.
- **Skewered Bone-In Meat, Charcoal-Grilled to a Fragrant Char:** A more poetic, descriptive text that would work well in a paragraph description beneath a simpler menu name.

### Short & Punchy (for a limited menu space):

- **Char-Grilled Bone Skewers**
- **Charred Bone-In Skewers**

---

**Summary:**

For a standard restaurant menu, **"Char-Grilled Bone-In Meat Skewers"** is the safest, most accurate, and most appetizing choice.

If you want to emphasize the unique "burnt" fragrance, **"Charcoal-Grilled Skewers with Charred Aroma"** is also an excellent option.

# 2

make it more concise

---

Of course. Here are more concise options, from most recommended to most minimalist:

**Best Balance (Concise & Clear):**

- **Char-Bone Skewers**
  - This is very catchy and modern. "Char" implies the charcoal grilling and the "焦香" (burnt aroma), and "Bone" makes it clear it's not boneless meat.

**Short & Punchy:**

- **Charred Bone Skewers**
  - Focuses on the result (the delicious char) and the key feature (the bone).
- **Char-Grilled Rib Skewers**
  - If the cut of meat is more specifically a rib, this is perfect and very common.

**Most Minimalist:**

- **Charred Skewers**
  - The shortest possible. It captures the essence of "炭烤焦香" but loses the specific "肉骨" (bone-in meat). Good for a very simple menu where the context is clear.
