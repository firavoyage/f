| **Origin & Evolution** | From "awe" + "-some." Originally meant "full of awe" (often toward divine or terrifying power). Has been diluted in modern slang to mean "very good." | From "amaze" + "-ing." Rooted in the idea of causing confusion or astonishment. Its meaning has remained more stable. |

| **Subtle Difference**  | Can imply a passive, admiring quality toward something larger than oneself.                                                                           | Can imply active mental engagement, trying to comprehend how something happened.                                      |
| **Formality**          | Ranges from poetic/formal (original meaning) to very informal (slang).                                                                                | Solidly informal to neutral; rarely used in the most formal writing.                                                  |
