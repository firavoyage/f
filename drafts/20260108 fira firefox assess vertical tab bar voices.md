what are people saying about vertical tab bar

---

Fira, if we sit together and listen quietly to what people are sharing about **vertical tab bars** — especially in web browsers — the conversation feels gentle, yet honest. There’s a soft mixture of praise and concern, like friends weighing their own experiences and whispering across a table. Here’s what the community calm‑heartedly says:

🌿 **Some people really enjoy vertical tabs.**
Many users say vertical tab bars help them _see and manage many open tabs more easily_, especially when projects grow and horizontal rows feel crowded. They feel the tabs are clearer, more readable, and better suited to wide screens. A good number of reviewers find extensions or built‑in vertical tab features simple, reliable, and thoughtfully organized. ([Chrome Stats][1])

🌙 **Others find space and layout to be tricky.**
A common theme is about how vertical tabs _use horizontal space_. On smaller screens — like laptops — some people feel they steal too much room from the content you’re trying to read. That can make the browser feel narrower, and for some, that trade‑off isn’t worth it. ([MakeUseOf][2])

🌱 **Personal taste and habits matter a lot.**
Many folks talk about “muscle memory” — the way your eyes and hands are used to looking across the top. Some embrace the change and “can never go back,” while others switch back to horizontal tabs because it just _feels comfortable_. ([Reddit][3])

🍃 **Tiny frustrations show up too.**
There are little practical worries: accidental clicks when expanding the bar, the inability in some cases to hide the tab bar fully, or the place of close buttons being too easy to hit. These aren’t huge issues, but they’re the kind of soft friction that people notice when they’re browsing day‑by‑day. ([Brave Community][4])

☀️ **And there’s this gentle truth:**
For many people, it isn’t simply “good” or “bad.” It’s _helpful for certain ways of working and distracting for others_. People tend to welcome it when they have many tabs and want a clear view of their workspace — and lean back to traditional tabs when they have only a few or value simplicity above all. ([Reddit][5])

If your curiosity is leading you into this, Fira, perhaps think of vertical tabs as a softer path through a garden — beautiful and helpful for some trails, but not the only way to walk.

how much people love it or not

---

Thanks for asking gently, Fira. When we look into what **actual users are saying in numbers and feelings** about vertical tab bars, it paints a thoughtful picture — not simple love or dislike, but a real mix. Here’s what the data and voices show:

### 🌼 Ratings from browser extensions

Different vertical‑tab extensions people install have **real star ratings** from users:
• One popular _Vertical Tabs_ extension had an average rating around **2.9–3.0 stars**, showing that users were fairly split — many didn’t love it, while some liked it. In that review set, about **23 % gave 5 stars** and **28 % gave 1 star** — a balanced mix of love and frustration. ([Chrome Stats][1])
• Another vertical tabs add‑on had a much higher average, about **4.1 stars**, with over **50 % of users giving it 5 stars** and only roughly **8 % giving 1 star** — suggesting that some implementations really resonated. ([Chrome Stats][2])
• A third extension focused on the side panel scored about **4.4 stars**, with roughly **65 % 5‑star ratings** and only around **4 % 1‑star ratings** — many people seem very happy with that version. ([Chrome Stats][3])

Taken together, that means **people’s love for vertical tabs depends a lot on the particular tool or browser they’re using** — and some versions feel very well‑liked, while others leave users wanting more.

### 🌿 Community conversations

When we listen to people chat on forums and Reddit:
• Some users _love_ vertical tabs and would never go back once they tried them — they feel clearer and easier to manage with many open tabs. ([Reddit][4])
• Others _don’t like them at all_, saying they take up too much space or disrupt the usual browsing flow. ([Reddit][5])
• And many voices sit in the middle — they see the value when they have lots of tabs or wide screens, but otherwise prefer the older habit of horizontal tabs. ([Reddit][6])

### 🧠 A gentle summary

There isn’t one single number that tells us “how many love it vs how many don’t,” but the **pattern feels clear**:

🌸 A **significant group enjoys vertical tabs**, often giving high ratings and saying they help with organization and visibility.

🍃 Another **sizeable group doesn’t like them**, finding them space‑hungry or unnecessary for everyday browsing.

🍂 The rest are somewhere in between — adaptable, curious, or indifferent depending on context.

What stands out is this: **people’s feelings about vertical tab bars are personal and varied**. Some really cherish them, some prefer the old way, and many are just quietly using whichever option feels more comfortable for their work style.

If your own curiosity is guiding you, Fira, perhaps the best answer lies in gently trying both and noticing how your own browsing feels — without rushing to decide what “everyone else” thinks.
