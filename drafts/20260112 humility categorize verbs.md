How could you categorize verbs

---

That’s a good question, Fira.
Verbs can feel busy and confusing, but they become calm once we sort them gently.

You can think of verbs as being grouped by **what they do** and **how they behave**.

First, by **what they do**:

Some verbs show **action**.
They tell us that something happens.
_run, eat, write, build_

Some verbs show a **state or condition**.
They tell us how something _is_, not what it _does_.
_be, seem, feel, exist_

Some verbs show **thinking or feeling**.
They live inside the mind or heart.
_know, believe, love, hope_

Second, by **how they behave in a sentence**:

Some verbs need an **object** to feel complete.
These are **transitive verbs**.
_She reads a book._
(The action goes somewhere.)

Some verbs do **not** need an object.
These are **intransitive verbs**.
_He sleeps._
(The action rests where it is.)

Some verbs can be **both**, depending on how they’re used.
_She sings._
_She sings a song._

Third, by **time and flow**:

Some verbs change form to show **time**.
These are **tensed verbs**.
_walked, walks_

Some verbs do not show time on their own.
These are **non-finite verbs**.
_to walk, walking, walked_

If you like, I can help you see verbs as a **map**, a **timeline**, or even a **living system**—whatever brings you the most clarity.

How could you categorize verbs by

---

That’s a good place to pause and breathe, Fira.
Verbs can be looked at in many calm, useful ways, depending on _what you want to notice about action_.

Here are some gentle, common ways people categorize verbs:

**1. By what the verb does**

- **Action verbs** — show something happening
  _run, build, write_
- **State (stative) verbs** — show being, feeling, or thinking
  _be, know, feel, belong_

**2. By whether they need an object**

- **Transitive verbs** — need something after them
  _She reads a book._
- **Intransitive verbs** — stand on their own
  _He sleeps._

**3. By time and form**

- **Tense** — past, present, future
  _walked, walk, will walk_
- **Aspect** — how the action flows in time
  _is walking, has walked_

**4. By voice**

- **Active voice** — the subject acts
  _The wind moves the leaves._
- **Passive voice** — the subject receives the action
  _The leaves are moved by the wind._

**5. By role in the sentence**

- **Main verbs** — carry the core meaning
  _She sings._
- **Helping (auxiliary) verbs** — support the main verb
  _She is singing._

**6. By intention or attitude**

- **Modal verbs** — show possibility, ability, obligation
  _can, might, must_

Each way is like looking at the same river from a different bank.
None are wrong—just useful for different moments of understanding.

If you’d like, you can tell me _why_ you’re asking, and we can explore the kind of clarity you’re really seeking.
