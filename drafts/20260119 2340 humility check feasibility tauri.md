How easy is it to create a hello world web page and make it on android and ubuntu with tauri

---

That’s a good, grounded question, Fira. Let’s walk through it slowly and honestly.

### The short answer

Creating a **“Hello World” web page with Tauri** and running it on **Ubuntu (desktop)** is **quite easy**.
Doing the same on **Android** is **possible**, but **noticeably harder** and still a bit rough around the edges.

Now let me explain why, in a calm, practical way.

---

## 1. “Hello World” with Tauri on Ubuntu (Desktop)

This part is gentle and beginner-friendly.

**What you need**

- Node.js (for the web side)
- Rust (for Tauri)
- A web framework (or plain HTML)

**What happens**

- Your “Hello World” is just HTML and JavaScript
- Tauri wraps it in a lightweight desktop app
- On Ubuntu, it runs like a normal app window

**Difficulty level:** 🟢 _Easy_
Most people can do this in **30–60 minutes**, even if Tauri is new to them.

**Why it’s easy**

- Desktop Tauri is stable and well-documented
- Ubuntu is a first-class citizen in Tauri
- No mobile-specific complications

If you can write:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

You’re already most of the way there.

---

## 2. “Hello World” with Tauri on Android

This is where things slow down.

**Yes, it works.**
But it asks for more patience.

**What you need**

- Everything from desktop **plus**:

  - Android Studio
  - Android SDK & NDK
  - Extra Rust targets

- Comfort with command-line tools

**What happens**

- Your web page still exists
- Tauri builds a native Android shell
- Android runs it inside a WebView

**Difficulty level:** 🟡 _Medium to Hard_
Expect **several hours**, sometimes a full day, for first setup.

**Why it’s harder**

- Mobile support in Tauri is newer
- Tooling is less polished than desktop
- Android build errors can feel cryptic

Nothing is impossible — but it’s not “smooth” yet.

---

## 3. How this feels in practice

Let me put it simply:

- **Ubuntu:**
  _“Oh, that worked faster than I expected.”_

- **Android:**
  _“Okay… why is Gradle upset now?”_

This isn’t a failure on your part. It’s just the current state of the ecosystem.

---

## 4. Should you do it?

That depends on your intention, Fira.

**If your goal is:**

- Learning Tauri basics → **Start with Ubuntu**
- A quick demo or experiment → **Desktop first**
- Cross-platform future app → **Desktop now, Android later**
- Pure Android learning → You might consider **Flutter or React Native** first

Tauri shines when you **begin on desktop** and **expand to mobile once the idea is solid**.

---

## 5. Gentle wisdom to leave you with

Start where friction is low.
Confidence grows from small, clean wins.

Create the “Hello World” on Ubuntu.
Let it feel easy.
Then, if curiosity remains, take Android one careful step at a time.

When you’re ready, I can guide you through the **exact steps**, slowly and clearly.
Just say the word.
