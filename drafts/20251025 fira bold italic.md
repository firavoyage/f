### Detailed Breakdown

#### **Bold**

Boldface type creates a stark contrast with the surrounding text, making it a powerful tool for hierarchy and scannability.

**When to Use Bold:**

1.  **Headings and Subheadings:** To structure a document and guide the reader's eye.
2.  **Highlighting Key Terms:** Especially in textbooks or manuals for definitions (e.g., The **mitochondria** is the powerhouse of the cell).
3.  **Warnings and Critical Information:** To ensure the reader doesn't miss something important (e.g., **Deadline: Friday**).
4.  **Call-to-Action Buttons:** On websites and apps (e.g., **Subscribe Now**, **Download**).
5.  **Product Names or Logos:** To make a brand name stand out.

**Key Takeaway:** Use bold sparingly. If everything is bold, nothing stands out.

#### _Italic_

Italics provide a more nuanced form of emphasis, often conveying a change in voice or adhering to stylistic rules.

**When to Use Italics:**

1.  **Emphasis:** To stress a word in a sentence, much like changing your tone of voice in speech (e.g., I _really_ need you to be there).
2.  **Titles of Works:** Books, movies, albums, magazines, plays, and long poems (e.g., I read _Dune_ and listened to _The Dark Side of the Moon_).
3.  **Foreign Words:** Words not commonly used in the main language (e.g., She had a certain _je ne sais quoi_).
4.  **Scientific Names:** For genus and species in biology (e.g., _Homo sapiens_).
5.  **Introducing a New Term:** The first time a key technical term is defined (e.g., This process, known as _photosynthesis_, is...).
6.  **Internal Thought or Dialogue:** In creative writing (e.g., _This can't be happening_, he thought).

**Key Takeaway:** Italics are for subtlety and convention, not for shouting.

### How to Use Them Together

You can combine bold and italic for even stronger, more specific emphasis, though this is less common.

- **_Bold Italic_**: Used for **extremely important text within a section that is already bold**, or to give a "shouted" word a specific tonal quality. Use this very rarely.

### Summary and Best Practices

- **Use Bold for Structure and Power.** It's your tool for making text scannable and for highlighting the most critical pieces of information.
- **Use Italic for Tone and Convention.** It's your tool for subtle emphasis, marking titles, and setting certain types of text apart according to style guides.
- **Avoid Overusing Either.** Excessive formatting makes text difficult to read and defeats the purpose of emphasis.
- **Don't Use Underline.** On the web, underline is reserved for hyperlinks. Rely on bold and italic for emphasis instead.
