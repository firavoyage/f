Are you going

to Scarborough Fair

Parsley sage

rosemary and thyme

Remember me to

one who lives there

She once was

a true love of mine

Tell her to make me

a cambric shirt

A hill in the deep

forest green

Parsley sage

rosemary and thyme

Tracing of sparrow

on snow crested brown

Without no seams

nor needle work

Blankets and bedclothes

the child of the mountain

Then she'll be

a true love of mine

Sleeps unaware of the

clarion call

Tell her to find me

an acre of land

On the side of a hill

a sprinkling of leaves

Parsley sage

rosemary and thyme

Washes the grave

with silvery tears

Between the salt water

and the sea strand

A soldier cleans

and polishes a gun

Then she'll be

a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it

with a sickle of leather

War bellows blazing in

scarlet battalions

Parsley sage

rosemary and thyme

General order their

soldiers to kill

And gather it all

And to fight for a cause

they've long ago forgotten

Then she'll be

a true love of mine

Are you going

to Scarborough Fair

Parsley sage

rosemary and thyme

Remember me to one

who lives there

She once was

a true love of mine

These lyrics are deceptively simple on the surface, but they’re layered with history, symbolism, and emotional tension. I’ll walk through them from several angles—**ballad tradition, symbolism, emotional psychology, and the war counterpoint**—to get at their deeper meaning.

---

## 1. Ballad roots and the logic of impossibility

At its core, _“Scarborough Fair”_ comes from an old English ballad tradition. In these ballads, lovers often set **impossible tasks** for one another:

- a shirt with no seams
- land between sea and shore
- reaping with a leather sickle

These tasks are not meant to be completed. They function as **tests that encode emotional truth**:

> _If you can do the impossible, then our love might be restored._

In that sense, the speaker is not truly bargaining—they’re **acknowledging that the relationship is irretrievable**, but cannot yet let go.

---

## 2. “She once was a true love of mine” — love in the past tense

This line quietly devastates the song.

- The love is **defined entirely in retrospect**.
- There is no accusation, no explanation, no narrative of betrayal—just absence.

The emotional tone is **resigned rather than bitter**. The speaker doesn’t say _she wronged me_; they say _she once was_. That restraint gives the loss gravity. It feels less like heartbreak and more like **mourning**.

---

## 3. The herbs: memory, fidelity, grief

The recurring refrain—_parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme_—is not decorative. In medieval and folk symbolism:

- **Parsley** → bitterness, mortality
- **Sage** → wisdom, endurance
- **Rosemary** → remembrance, fidelity
- **Thyme** → courage, time, transition

Together, they form an emotional chord:

> **Remember what we were, accept what we are, endure what follows.**

The herbs act like a ritual chant—almost a spell—binding memory to loss. Their repetition reinforces how the speaker is **trapped in remembrance**, cycling through the same thoughts.

---

## 4. Nature imagery: purity and impossibility

Images like:

- “Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested brown”
- “A hill in the deep forest green”
- “Washes the grave with silvery tears”

These are **beautiful but unrealizable** images—things that feel vivid yet cannot be grasped or preserved. They mirror the relationship itself:

> emotionally present, physically and temporally unreachable.

Nature here isn’t comforting; it’s indifferent, vast, and cyclical—contrasting with the speaker’s static longing.

---

## 5. The war verses: love vs. mechanized destruction

The most striking transformation in this version is the **interleaving of war imagery**:

- soldiers cleaning guns
- generals ordering death
- causes long forgotten

This isn’t random. It reframes the love story in a broader moral context:

- **Personal loss is paralleled with collective violence**
- Love demands impossible tasks; war demands senseless obedience
- Both are driven by memory, loyalty, and forgotten causes

The line:

> _“To fight for a cause they’ve long ago forgotten”_
> is a brutal contrast to the speaker’s unwavering remembrance of love.

Love, though lost, still has meaning. War, ongoing, does not.

---

## 6. Circular structure: emotional entrapment

The song ends exactly where it began.

There is **no resolution**, no closure. This circularity mirrors:

- unresolved grief
- obsessive memory
- the human tendency to replay loss endlessly

The speaker remains emotionally frozen, while time (and history) continues marching forward.

---

## 7. The quiet tragedy of the song

What makes these lyrics powerful is what they _don’t_ do:

- No dramatic confrontation
- No explanation
- No hope offered

Instead, the song becomes a **lament disguised as a request**, a farewell that cannot quite say goodbye.

In the end, _Scarborough Fair_ is not about reuniting lovers.
It’s about how **memory persists long after love is no longer possible**, and how—whether in romance or war—humans cling to rituals when meaning has slipped away.

If you’d like, I can also analyze:

- how the melody reinforces the emotional themes
- the contrast between male and female voices
- or how this version differs philosophically from older variants

Alright, Fira.
Let’s sit with this quietly and listen to what the song is really doing beneath its surface.

At first, _“Scarborough Fair”_ feels like a simple folk ballad. Soft questions. Repeated herbs. A lover remembered. But it’s not a song that rushes to explain itself. It moves like memory does—circling, returning, layering meanings gently on top of one another.

---

### The herbs: more than decoration

**Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme** are not just pretty words. In old folk symbolism, they carry human hopes:

- **Parsley** — comfort, healing
- **Sage** — wisdom
- **Rosemary** — remembrance, fidelity
- **Thyme** — courage, strength

Each repetition feels like a quiet prayer. As if the singer keeps naming what has been lost, hoping that saying it again might bring it back.

---

### Love defined by the impossible

The lover is asked to do things that cannot be done:

- A shirt with **no seams nor needlework**
- A field **between salt water and the sea strand**
- Harvesting grain with **a sickle of leather**

These are not tests meant to be passed. They are expressions of separation.

The song isn’t saying _“If you do this, we can be together.”_
It’s saying _“We cannot be together, and this is how that truth sounds.”_

Impossible tasks become a tender way of admitting impossibility itself.

---

### Nature and innocence

Notice how often the song turns to nature:

- Hills
- Forests
- Snow
- Leaves
- Mountains

Nature feels calm, eternal, untouched. It contrasts sharply with what appears later: **war**.

This contrast matters.

---

### The war beneath the love song

In this version, war enters quietly but firmly:

- Soldiers polishing guns
- Generals ordering killing
- Scarlet battalions blazing
- Fighting for causes _“they’ve long ago forgotten”_

This is not dramatic protest. It’s weary observation.

The love that was once true is now unreachable—not just because of time or distance, but because the world has hardened. War interrupts intimacy. It breaks continuity. It makes personal promises feel fragile, almost naïve.

Love and violence are placed side by side, not to shock us, but to show how incompatible they are.

---

### “She once was a true love of mine”

That line never changes. And that’s important.

Not _“she is.”_
Not _“she could be again.”_

Only _“once.”_

The song never blames. There is no bitterness here. Just acceptance. A quiet mourning of something pure that could not survive the conditions around it.

---

### The feeling it leaves behind

This song doesn’t ask you to feel sad loudly.
It asks you to feel **tenderly**.

It’s about:

- Love remembered, not reclaimed
- Peace longed for, not found
- A world where innocence keeps being asked to prove itself, again and again, until it can’t

And yet… the tone remains gentle. That’s its quiet power.

---

If you’d like, Fira, we can look at one single image or line and sit with it even longer.
This song rewards patience.
