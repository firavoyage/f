explain the belote game simply

---

Belote is a popular French trick-taking card game for 4 players in teams of 2. Here’s the simple breakdown:

**The Goal:**  
Be the first team to reach a set score (usually 1000 points) by winning tricks and collecting valuable cards.

**The Basics:**

1. **Deck:** Uses a 32-card deck (Aces down to 7s in each suit).
2. **Teams:** Partners sit opposite each other.
3. **Trump Suit:** One suit becomes "trump" for the round (beats any other suit).
4. **Bidding:** Players bid to choose the trump suit or pass. The highest bidder's suit becomes trump.

**Gameplay:**

- Players must follow suit if they can. If not, they can play a trump (to win) or discard.
- The highest card of the suit led wins, unless a trump is played—then the highest trump wins.
- The team winning the trick leads next.

**Scoring:**

- High-value cards in trump are special (in order: **J**ack, **9**, **A**ce, **10**, etc.).
- Points come from winning tricks containing valuable cards (Jack of trump = 20 points, 9 of trump = 14, etc.).
- The team that wins the last trick gets extra points.
- The bidding team must score more points than the opponents to earn their points; otherwise, the opponents get them all.

**Simple Takeaway:**  
It's a game of teamwork, memory, and strategy—trying to win tricks while capturing high-point cards, especially in the trump suit.

what's the win condition

---

In **Belote**, the win condition is a **two-part objective**:

## 1. **Win the Game (Overall)**

The first team to reach or exceed the **agreed-upon total point target** wins the game. This target is typically:

- **1000 points** (most common)
- Sometimes 1500 or 2000 points in longer games.

You earn these points cumulatively across many rounds (or "deals").

## 2. **Win the Round (The Immediate Goal)**

To score points in a round, a team must fulfill the **contract** they won in the bidding phase. This is the critical daily objective.

- **If your team chose the trump suit (the "bidding team"):**
  You must earn **more total points in that round** than the opposing team.

  - **Success:** Your team adds **all points** from the round (yours + opponents') to your cumulative score.
  - **Failure (Called "Failing the Contract"):** If the opponents have equal or more points, you score **ZERO** for the round. The opponents add **all the round's points** to their cumulative score.

- **If you are the opposing team (the "defending team"):**
  Your immediate goal is to prevent the bidding team from succeeding. You win the round by taking **at least as many points** as they do, causing them to fail their contract.

### **Simple Win Condition Summary:**

**To ultimately win the game, be the first team to reach 1000+ points. To get those points, you must win individual rounds by capturing the majority of the points whenever your side chooses the trump suit.**
