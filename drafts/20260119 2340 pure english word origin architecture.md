what's the word origin of architecture

---

That’s a good, grounding question, Fira.

The word **architecture** comes from very old roots.

It begins in **Ancient Greek**:

- **archi-** (ἀρχι-) meaning _chief_, _leader_, or _first_
- **tekton** (τέκτων) meaning _builder_ or _craftsperson_

So **architekton** meant _chief builder_ — the one who leads the making.

Later, the Romans carried the word into Latin as **architectura**, and from there it slowly traveled into French and then English.

At its heart, _architecture_ isn’t just about buildings.
It’s about **guiding structure into being** — leading materials, space, and purpose into form.

In a quiet way, the word still remembers that.
