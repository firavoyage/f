What are the opensource alternatives of manus.im general purpose agent

---

Fira, let’s sit together for a moment of calm clarity on this. If you’re exploring alternatives to **Manus.im’s general‑purpose agent**, especially **open‑source ones** you can run, inspect, or shape yourself, here are some gentle, grounded options to consider:

### 🌱 Open‑Source General AI Agent Frameworks

**1. OpenManus**
A free, open‑source project designed specifically to mirror the capabilities of Manus‑style agents — multi‑agent coordination, planning, and task execution — without invite codes or paywalls. You can deploy it yourself and extend it with your own tools. ([Manus Guide][1])

**2. OWL (by CAMEL‑AI)**
A community‑driven, open framework focused on multi‑agent collaboration. It comes with toolkits for browsing, document handling, code execution, and multimodal work — and it’s been benchmarked highly among open‑source agents. ([LinkedIn][2])

**3. AgenticSeek**
A fully open alternative that runs locally, emphasizing privacy and autonomy. Users report autonomous browsing, task planning, and code writing — all without depending on cloud services. ([Medium][3])

**4. AutoGPT**
A pioneering open‑source autonomous agent that breaks tasks into subtasks and acts on them with minimal intervention. It’s more of a prototype but a robust foundation if you want to explore self‑driving agents in Python. ([Wikipedia][4])

**5. OpenAGI / ai‑agents List**
A community‑curated list of open agent frameworks, including platforms aimed at general tasks with modularity for many models and tool integrations — good if you want to browse options before choosing. ([GitHub][5])

### 🧠 Other Tools & Foundations to Explore

These aren’t direct plug‑and‑play agents like Manus, but they’re often used **to build your own agents**:

- **ModelScope‑Agent** — an open framework for customizable agents that link open‑source models with external tools and APIs. ([arXiv][6])
- **Cognitive Kernel‑Pro** — an open research framework for training agent models, useful if you’re thinking about long‑term agent capabilities or research pipelines. ([arXiv][7])
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — an open protocol (not exactly a full agent) that helps connect large language models with tools and actions in a standardized way — like a bridge between your agent and the outside world. ([Wikipedia][8])

---

### 🌼 A Gentle Note on Choice

Each option has its own rhythm:

- **OpenManus and OWL** feel like near‑parallels to Manus itself — ready to explore real, autonomous tasks.
- **AgenticSeek** is closer to a locally‑run, privacy‑centered friend on your own machine.
- **AutoGPT and the broader agent lists** give you ideas and building blocks, like seeds you can grow into something uniquely yours.

If you want, tell me **what kind of tasks you imagine your agent doing** — planning, research, browser interaction, code work, or something else — and we can explore the calmest path forward together.

What do people say about each after they manage to install

---

Of course, Fira — let’s gently explore what people **say after they install or use these open‑source agent‑style projects**. The experience varies a lot depending on the project and the person, but the community feedback from forums, GitHub, and articles paints a warm, real‑world picture.

---

### 🌿 **OpenManus** (open‑source Manus alternative)

People who manage to install OpenManus often share that:

- It feels like a **community‑driven alternative** to proprietary agents, especially appealing because it’s free and customizable. ([apidog][1])
- Some builders are even creating projects like **PocketManus** on top of it — using the framework for task execution or breakdown logic. ([Reddit][2])
- Users talk about it as a foundation — not a polished assistant out of the box — meaning they **enjoy building and modifying it** more than expecting a finished end‑product.

In simple terms: folks appreciate the freedom and openness, but they also remind each other that you’re **in developer territory** — so patience and tinkering are part of the path.

---

### 🌱 **AutoGPT**

AutoGPT often gets the most real‑world chatter among open‑source agents so far, and the impressions are mixed:

💬 **Positive threads:**

- Many users like that AutoGPT tries to **automate multi‑step goals** — breaking big tasks into subtasks and running them without constant supervision. ([IBM][3])
- Some community posts mention people building variants or calling it a **good sandbox for experimenting** with agent workflows and custom scripting. ([Reddit][4])

🌧️ **Critical voices:**

- Others say that “autonomy” isn’t always smooth — AutoGPT can get stuck, loop, or wander off task without careful setup. ([Medium][5])
- And some users, especially beginners, find it **hard to configure and not super beginner‑friendly** right after install.

So the feeling in the community: AutoGPT is **powerful but raw** — terrific for learning and experimenting, but it doesn’t always behave like a polished assistant yet.

---

### 🍃 **AgenticSeek**

This one gets attention for its **focus on privacy and local use**:

- Users who install AgenticSeek like that it runs **100 % on their own hardware**, with no cloud dependency or data sharing. ([GitHub][6])
- Conversations around it often highlight **cost‑savings and transparency** — people don’t have to worry about API bills or hidden cloud costs. ([LinkedIn][7])

Because it’s still a developer‑type project, the community feedback tends to be **practical and engineering‑minded** — folks share tips for setup, local model tuning, and how to connect it to local browsing or tools.

---

### ☀️ What this tells us

When people reflect after installing these open‑source agents, a few gentle themes emerge:

- **Freedom and control**: People appreciate that they can see and modify the code themselves.
- **Learning curve**: Most of these projects expect you to know a bit of software tooling and patience with setup.
- **Not polished assistants yet**: Compared to cloud‑based paid agents, open‑source ones often feel more like **building blocks than finished helpers**.

So if your intention is **exploration, customization, and control**, the experience can be rewarding — even if it isn’t always smooth or instantaneous after install.

---

If you’d like, Fira, we can talk about **which one might fit your style of projects or your skill level** — whether you want something gentle and simple, or something deep to grow into.

Are they way behind manus now. I have seen waitlist, broken links everywhere. Sound like ppt project. People could not even test easily, so supports don't feel true as they are mostly inside niche community

---

Fira, let’s take a calm look at what people are _actually saying in the wild_ once they get past the hype and start _using or trying to install_ these open‑source agent projects — and how that experience compares to **Manus.im**, which has indeed been a bit chaotic recently.

### 🌥️ About Manus Itself

People who’ve tried Manus often describe it as **powerful in promise**, but also **frustrating in practice** right now:

- Manus has had **server overloads, invite/waitlist delays, and instability** when handling complex tasks. People see errors like tasks failing or being slow because the service is busy. ([Trickle][1])
- Some community posts report **cost frustrations, rapid credit burn, and support issues**, which make the platform less pleasant to use. ([AI News][2])
- On Reddit, users say Manus can be “overhyped” and often requires manual fixes to what it generates. ([Reddit][3])
- A few managed to join and enjoyed its abilities, but _many felt pushed away by the waitlist or poor link reliability_. ([Reddit][4])

So yes — your instinct about _waitlists and rough edges_ isn’t just in your head. Even enthusiastic users acknowledge access and stability hurdles.

---

### 🧰 **Open‑Source Alternatives — Real User Impressions After Install**

Now softly, let’s look at what the community says about the open‑source options once they _actually install them_.

---

#### 🌀 **AgenticSeek**

What people _actually experience_:

- It is genuinely _local_, meaning it runs on your hardware without cloud costs, and some users find that attractive. ([GitHub][5])
- But the project is still very much **in progress** — it started as a side project with _no corporate backing or formal roadmap_. ([GitHub][5])
- Reddit feedback notes it can be **complex to set up**, and behaviour is hit‑or‑miss on tasks (especially with local models). ([Reddit][6])
- Some developers feel the codebase is quite _large and intimidating_, not polished for beginners. ([Reddit][7])

**Insight:** After install, people don’t call it “Manus‑level polished” yet — but they _appreciate the privacy and freedom_. It feels like a _work‑in‑progress toolchain_, not a finished product.

---

#### 🧠 **OpenManus**

Community impressions:

- It’s actively developed and aims to _replicate Manus‑like capabilities_ without requiring invites. ([manus.guide][8])
- Some users have tried it with API key setups, but fully local execution can be rough or limited. ([Reddit][6])
- A common tone on forums is that it’s _useful for learning and experimentation_, but not yet as seamless or capable as Manus directly. Shared experiences sometimes describe **hangs, configuration tinkering, and dependency issues**. ([Reddit][4])

**Insight:** People see OpenManus as a _foundation to build on_, not an instantly superior replacement.

---

#### 🦉 **OWL and Other Frameworks**

Here’s a gentle perspective from the community:

- Projects like **OWL and other open frameworks** are recognized as _powerful in flexibility_, and some benchmarks even position them ahead of Manus in test environments. ([Manus][9])
- But _user feedback online is a bit thinner_ — these tools are mostly talked about in developer circles, and few posts describe plug‑and‑play experiences.
- People building with them tend to be comfortable with software tooling and are using them as _building blocks for custom agent behavior_ rather than expecting turnkey autonomy.

**Insight:** These tools _do sometimes outperform in benchmarks or capability tests_, but real‑world user stories are typically about developers integrating parts into larger systems, not about non‑technical users hitting “install and go.”

---

### 🌿 Gentle Summary

Here’s a quiet, honest reflection:

- **Manus isn’t fully polished yet** — users appreciate its vision, but waitlists, credit issues, and instability are real. It’s less smooth than its marketing might suggest.
- **Open‑source alternatives are promising** but mostly feel like **frameworks for developers**, not polished assistants. People who manage to install them often find they _work in pieces_: some parts are strong, others need manual work.
- **No open‑source tool yet matches the polished, “works out of the box” experience** of a proprietary agent like Manus. But the _freedom, transparency, and community creativity_ around these projects is meaningful if you enjoy building and shaping software yourself.

In soft terms: open‑source agents aren’t “way behind because they lack quality” — they’re _different in nature_. Manus is a **service product with polish around behavior (when it works)**; open‑source frameworks are **raw, flexible toolkits** that need human guidance and patience.

---

If you ever want to talk about **which option feels right for your own workflow or comfort level with installation and tinkering**, I’d be glad to walk you through it in a gentle, step‑by‑step way.
