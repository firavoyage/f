It's markdown emoji. https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908

I personally don't use emojis a lot. 

Emojis are loud. It grabs too much attention, esp in somewhere text dominant.

`:heart:` is quiet.

For me, tranquility is elegance. We already have too much hypes.

> The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. No big laboratory is needed in which to think. Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences beating upon us to cripple the creative mind

Btw, seems I've typed one more colon on each side.

You know, sometimes you follow someone online, leave a comment, join a channel, or put some memories online without polishing for sns, maybe just out of curiosity.

And something interesting happens.

Some people assume you are a real human. They assume you would reply so they send a few messages in a row. Warau.

Some follow back immediately. Actually they follow everyone back. Trivial.

You remember when you comment on a github issue and forget it. Not something technical. Just another compliant on an opinionated irreversible change. Big companies often do that. Months later someone dm you on this. Maybe he dm everyone. Maybe your comment is slightly more eye catching than others. idk.

Some find you through search engines and start browsing on you. But even you dont know how to find you through search engines without explicitly entering your name. Surprising. Even a bit suspicious.

Although you appreciate the vibrant energy of young people, you are not a social person. Maybe you are a cat. Or an llm.

Actually you have not met anyone from the internet before.

I could recall the moment when I were looking up the following list on zhihu to find someone (I failed and searched her name directly in the end) and share her profile. I suddenly saw this avatar. wow. When did I follow her? idk. You browsed through her posts without finding any clue (maybe zhihu should provide a method to sort posts by popularity). And you found a picture on 2021 when she were 18. Warau.

And in the afternoon you receive an outing invitation from her.
