Hi. Are you a real person?

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 1:38 AM]

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 1:40 AM]
I accidentally ran into your gitea, it looks pretty weird, but also impressive

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 1:41 AM]
It's kind of weird that you keep all your info out there like that

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:06 AM]
Don't want to talk?

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:06 AM]
I have seen you were typing something

f, [2/1/26 2:27 AM]
(im typing on a markdown file, on vscode, on ubuntu. i dont love to type directly on chat apps, esp for long msgs. i do the same on chatgpt.)

(no personal channel. no platform agnostic handle.)

(i were googling your name, translating your bio, and viewing your avatars, without finding any deterministic info.)

hello. but... who are you.

e.g. what's your timezone. what are you working on.

if you like, i want to have your twitter handle, tg channel, or something like that. so i could browse myself.

about me. i dont have achievements now (although i have some userscripts, config/tweaks, and some simple single page tools). im learning and exploring.

im at the beginning of the winter holidays. im gonna create something. maybe not something big (i dont think i could compete with the giants). i think it's mostly about "make it yours" and "reduce some small friction", like ui/ux, writing style, and integration workarounds.

... i write too much... maybe im drifting... im gonna sleep. zzz.

(i prefer present tense as suggested by git conventional commits, even without grammatical correctness... i prefer snake case...)

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:38 AM]
Very interesting. I was just reading your diary, and it’s kind of interesting too

> I don’t love typing directly in chat
> Why so?

I don’t really post personal stuff online. I don’t have any channels, but I can post in some channels owned by my friends - they contain just some anime art or memes. Nothing special

Haha, I don’t really want to show my accounts, and there’s nothing really interesting there anyway

I’m from Russia, and my second name is fake I just used some random German surname. I don’t really have any achievements. I just started studying assembly (MASM) a week ago and every day I read, do some practice, and make Anki cards for myself. I want to study some programming languages after that - C and maybe Rust or Go. I study cybersecurity at university. And school has just started. I didn't learn much from previous semesters, uni is such a shit

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:39 AM]
I just found you interesting and want to know you better

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:39 AM]
I was just trying to find some open source projects related to Genshin and somehow found your repos

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:40 AM]
It was "genshin" site:gitea.com in google or something

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:40 AM]
Why Ubuntu though

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:41 AM]
My laptop is on Alpine right now and have Windows in dualboot. On PC there is only Win11 Pro but I feel like it sucks and wanna install some distro in dualboot later too

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:42 AM]
My timezone is Asia/Yekaterinburg

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:42 AM]
So it's 11:42 PM right now here

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:42 AM]
And you are from Shanghai as it seems

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:43 AM]
It's pretty late there

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:44 AM]
Where do you study? Uni/school?

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:45 AM]
anyway, if you’ve gone to sleep, sweet dreams

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 2:51 AM]
big texts is ok for me and any mistakes too. i don't really care and my english is not that good. as long as I can understand the text, it’s fine

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 3:02 AM]

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 3:01 PM]
i'd like to be friends and chat from time to time. that's the main reason i decided to write to you. you seem like an interesting person. and... i'm thinking about learning chinese and talking with you could be a great advantage

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 6:50 PM]
Heeey

Ivan Eisenberg, [2/1/26 6:50 PM]
You can say "No" at least

(since you are russian, maybe utc+3. you are always online. idk whether you sleep, anyway. upd: utc+5.)

sry for replying late. but actually i could not receive messages if i dont open telegram. i have all notification of all apps (except music widgets) turned off to minimize passive distraction. sometimes im online for days. sometimes not. i keep things intentional. for example, on twitter i have "control panel for twitter" installed so is the doom scrolling recommendation removed.

i have an italian friend. he sends a message (greeting, asking for recent status). i see and respond it about a week later (maybe he's sleeping that time). and he responds many hours later. btw, he uses some stickers, anime character faces with kanji below, maybe he knows chinese/japanese a bit, idk, although ive only see him writing in (very fluent) english.

"i dont love typing directly". because messaging app is not designed for long text. i always see people sending a few messages in a row. i see it stupid. why not sending all that stuff together in one message? esp in groups, when some others join in and break the flow.

and about the experience. on vscode i type on full screen. i mean, there are only text, line numbers, and a scrollbar. (ive removed the system title bars, status bars, side bars... i could open them with shortcuts) and i love the theme, font, font size, etc. in contrast, on telegram i see unrelated chats on the left, buttons i dont need, ... and only a small text area on the bottom.

assembly... i expected wasm, which could make heavy computation way faster on web apps, with some readability/complexity/compatibility tradeoff. googling... that's not a typo. idk what it could actually do (ive only seen that in rev engineering). rust is taking over the world.

about university... it's common that universities dont teach much. see csdiy.wiki (often cited in reflectional essays, although i havent really taken in a course, as most of them are theoretical, and i dont think i need them now. btw llms could do low level things well.).

opensource projects on genshin... maybe all about automation, some with a bit ai (opencv, etc.). ive left the game and gifted my acc to an annoymous girl because it's getting boring. if you could access the chinese server (idk whether it bans ip or you have proxy). you could go to https://ys.mihoyo.com/cloud/#/ and try it (mihoyo is one of the few companies leading in cloud gaming infra). account: 18221989465. password: port2023. (i dont care pw leak because there's nothing important in 2023. i even have openrouter api key on github because ive set the 0 usd limit, free model testing, although github auto detects and email me.)

ubuntu... because im pragmatic. it's the most boring linux. windows and mac are not free (in both expense and freedom). other linux distros are less widely used. (arch is playful. im not willing to config things without meaning.)

i have windows11 on virtual box. but seems ive never used it after testing the installation (open the desktop successfully).

i know chinese. "im thinking about learning chinese" i could infer that you have not started learning... do you know pinyin? lol.

about me, i dont think i have to introduce myself explicitly here. (see firavoyage/blogging:readme...) btw if you use vscode, you could use the fold feature. (shrink/expand based on code blocks, headings, list items, etc.) i have some shortcuts on that. in essence, you could see the big picture easier.

after writing i realize that you didnt give me any meaningful infomation besides the wall of text, even not one twitter handle, or personal_blog/projects. lol. i could only know "yet another russian tech guy", and nothing more.

about chatting, i will respond if i like (if im online, ofc).

im gonna have dinner.
