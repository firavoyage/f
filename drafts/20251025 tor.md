how to disable tor for https sites in tor browser

---

Of course. This is a common question, but the answer is more complex than it seems.

### The Short, Direct Answer

**You cannot selectively disable Tor only for HTTPS sites within the Tor Browser.** The Tor Browser is a hardened application designed to route _all_ your traffic through the Tor network, regardless of whether the destination site uses HTTP or HTTPS. This is a core security feature to protect your anonymity.

Attempting to bypass Tor for specific sites would fundamentally break the browser's security model and expose your real IP address.

---

### Understanding the "Why" Behind This Limitation

The Tor Browser is not just a normal browser with a proxy setting. It's a complete package designed for anonymity:

1.  **All-or-Nothing Principle:** If the browser allowed connections outside the Tor network, it would be trivial for a malicious website to trick the browser into leaking your real IP address (e.g., via WebRTC, a direct image request, or a DNS lookup).
2.  **Fingerprinting Protection:** The browser is meticulously configured to look like every other Tor Browser user. Allowing some sites to see your real connection would make you unique and easily identifiable.

---

### What Are Your Practical Alternatives?

Since you cannot do this within the Tor Browser itself, you have a few options, each with different trade-offs in terms of convenience, security, and privacy.

#### Option 1: Use a Separate Standard Browser (Most Common)

This is the simplest and recommended approach for most users.

- **Keep the Tor Browser** for all your anonymous, privacy-sensitive browsing.
- **Use Firefox, Chrome, Brave, etc.** for your regular browsing of HTTPS sites where you don't need anonymity.

**Security Consideration:** This is safe as long as you understand the context. The Tor Browser protects your identity from the sites you visit. Your standard browser does not. Make sure you don't log into the same accounts in both browsers, as this could link your anonymous identity to your real one.

#### Option 2: Use a VPN (Provides a Fixed Location, Not Anonymity)

You can connect to a VPN and then use your regular browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.).

- **Pros:** Often faster than Tor, good for accessing geo-restricted content, and hides your traffic from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- **Cons:** Does **not** provide the same level of anonymity as Tor. The VPN provider knows your real IP address and can see all your traffic. You are placing your trust in a single company, not a distributed volunteer network.

#### Option 3: Use `torbrowser-launcher` (Linux) or Custom Proxy Settings

This is an advanced method and **not recommended for most users** due to the high risk of configuration errors.

On some Linux distributions, you can install the Tor Browser using a package called `torbrowser-launcher`. You could theoretically:

1.  Launch the Tor Browser normally for anonymous browsing.
2.  **Close it completely.**
3.  Manually configure your system's network settings or your standard browser to use a different proxy (or no proxy).
4.  Use the `torbrowser-launcher` command to start the browser again, which might then bypass Tor.

**⚠️ Major Warning:** This is extremely risky. It's very easy to make a mistake and accidentally leak your IP address. The Tor Browser project strongly advises against this, and this method may not work with the standard Tor Browser download.

### Summary: What You Should Do

| Your Goal                                                              | Recommended Solution                                                                                |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Browse specific HTTPS sites without Tor's speed penalty or blocks.** | **Use a separate standard browser** (Firefox, Chrome, etc.). This is the safest and easiest method. |
| **Hide your traffic from your ISP but don't need strong anonymity.**   | **Use a reputable VPN service** with your standard browser.                                         |
| **Achieve maximum anonymity for sensitive browsing.**                  | **Use the Tor Browser as intended** with all traffic routed through Tor.                            |

**In short: Don't try to hack the Tor Browser. Use the right tool for the job. The Tor Browser is for anonymity. For everything else, use a different browser.**

how to disable tor for https sites in tor browser

---

You can't selectively disable Tor for _only_ HTTPS sites in the Tor Browser.

The browser is designed as an all-or-nothing system: **all** of your browsing traffic (both HTTP and HTTPS) is routed through the Tor network. This is essential to its core purpose of providing anonymity.

---

## Why This Isn't a Feature

Selectively sending some traffic (like HTTPS) outside the Tor network while the rest goes through it would make your browsing habits unique and easy to track. This defeats the entire purpose of using Tor Browser.

- **Anonymity:** The goal of Tor is to blend your traffic with that of all other users. If your browser starts making direct connections to HTTPS sites, it creates a unique "fingerprint" that can be used to identify you.
- **Security Model:** The browser is built to prevent _any_ traffic from accidentally leaking your real IP address. Allowing HTTPS connections to bypass Tor would break this fundamental security guarantee.
- **HTTPS-Only Mode:** Tor Browser _does_ have an "HTTPS-Only Mode." This feature does the opposite of what you're asking: it _forces_ sites to use a secure HTTPS connection (over the Tor network), falling back to a warning if a site only supports insecure HTTP.

### Disabling Tor Entirely (Not Recommended)

While you can't disable Tor for _just_ HTTPS sites, it is technically possible to modify advanced settings (in `about:config`) to disable the proxy and stop the browser from using the Tor network _at all_.

**This is strongly discouraged.** Doing so turns Tor Browser into a less-functional version of Firefox that offers no privacy protection and makes your browser fingerprint highly unique and trackable. If you need a regular browser, you should use Firefox, Chrome, or another standard browser.

how to enable dark color scheme auto detection in tor browser disabling fingerprint protection

---

This is a crucial security trade-off, and it's important to understand exactly what you are doing.

### **_ Strong Security Warning _**

Disabling this setting **defeats a primary purpose of using the Tor Browser**.

- **What you are asking to do:** You are asking to disable Tor Browser's anti-fingerprinting protection.
- **Why this is dangerous:** Tor Browser works by making all users look as similar as possible. One way it does this is by _lying_ to websites, telling every website that you are using the "light" color scheme, regardless of your actual system setting.
- **The risk:** If you allow websites to detect your _true_ "dark" or "light" mode preference, you are providing a piece of information that makes you **unique** and **identifiable**. This makes it significantly easier for websites to track you and "fingerprint" your browser, even over the Tor network.

**Enabling this feature will actively reduce your anonymity.**

---

### How to Disable Fingerprint Protection to Allow Dark Mode

If you understand the risks and still wish to proceed, you must change a setting in Tor Browser's advanced configuration.

1.  Open the Tor Browser.
2.  In the address bar at the top, type `about:config` and press **Enter**.
3.  A warning page will appear ("Here be dragons!"). Click the button that says "**Accept the Risk and Continue**".
4.  In the search bar at the top of the `about:config` page, type or paste the following:
    `privacy.resistFingerprinting`
5.  You will see the `privacy.resistFingerprinting` preference. By default, it is set to `true`.
6.  **Double-click** on the word `true` (or click the toggle button on the far right) to change its value to `false`.

After setting it to `false`, restart the Tor Browser. It will now read your operating system's theme (light or dark) and websites that support `prefers-color-scheme` will auto-detect it.

### Alternative: Changing Only the Browser Theme (Safe)

If you _only_ want the Tor Browser's _own interface_ (toolbars, menus, settings page) to be dark, you can do this **without** disabling fingerprinting protection. This is the recommended and safe method.

1.  Click the menu button (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner.
2.  Go to **Add-ons and themes** (or **Themes**).
3.  Select the **Dark** theme.

This will change the browser's appearance _locally_ but will **not** tell websites that you are using dark mode, thus preserving your anonymity.

# 1.3 2

privacy.resistFingerprinting is not writable. there's a lock icon

---

You are correct. The Tor Project intentionally locks that setting in `about:config` to prevent users from accidentally (or intentionally) disabling the browser's most important anti-fingerprinting feature.

As I warned before, **disabling this will severely damage your anonymity on the Tor network.** You will no longer "blend in" with other Tor users and will be providing websites with a unique piece of data (your OS color scheme) to track you.

If you fully understand this risk and wish to proceed, you cannot change it from the `about:config` interface. You must override the setting by creating a configuration file. The most reliable method is to use a `policies.json` file.

### How to Override the Locked Setting (Recommended Method)

This method creates an administrative policy file that Tor Browser will read on startup.

1.  **Find your Tor Browser installation folder.** This is the folder where you first extracted Tor Browser. It contains `start-tor-browser.desktop` and a folder named `Browser`.

2.  **Navigate to the correct sub-folder:**

    - Inside the `Browser` folder, look for a folder named `distribution`.
    - If the `distribution` folder does not exist, create it.
    - Your path should look like this: `[...]/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/distribution/`

3.  **Create the `policies.json` file:**

    - Inside the `distribution` folder, create a new plain text file.
    - Name this file exactly: `policies.json` (make sure it's not `policies.json.txt`).

4.  **Edit the file:**

    - Open `policies.json` with a plain text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on
      macOS, or any code editor).
    - Copy and paste the following text **exactly** into the file:

    <!-- end list -->

    ```json
    {
      "policies": {
        "Preferences": {
          "privacy.resistFingerprinting": {
            "Value": false,
            "Status": "locked"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **Save the file and restart Tor Browser.**

When you restart, Tor Browser will load this policy, which forces `privacy.resistFingerprinting` to `false`. The setting will now be locked in the `false` position. Your browser will now report your operating system's true color scheme to websites, allowing for automatic dark mode detection at the cost of your anonymity.

### How to Revert the Change

To restore your protection, simply **delete the `policies.json` file** you created and restart Tor Browser. The setting will revert to its default, locked, and safe state (`true`).

how to set google as the default search engine on tor browser bypassing its optionated privacy rules

---

You can change the default search engine in Tor Browser through its settings, but it's important to understand what "bypassing its... privacy rules" actually means in this context.

Doing this doesn't break the Tor network's routing—Google will still see your connection coming from a Tor exit node, not your real IP address. However, you will be bypassing the _data privacy_ rules Tor Browser provides by default.

The default search engine, **DuckDuckGo**, is used specifically because it **does not log your search history, IP address, or any personal information**.

When you switch to Google, you are **voluntarily sending all your search queries** to a company that tracks and profiles you.

### How to Change the Search Engine

If you understand the risks and still wish to proceed, the steps are the same as in Firefox:

1.  Click the **menu button** (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  In the menu on the left, click **Search**.
4.  Under the **Default Search Engine** section, you will see a dropdown menu.
5.  Select **Google** from the list. If it's not there, you can add it by scrolling down to "Add search engines."

---

### ⚠️ A Critical Warning About Privacy

Your request to "bypass" the privacy rules is exactly what you will be doing, but it will be **to your own disadvantage**.

- **You Are Opting-In to Tracking:** By using Google, you are allowing it to log every search you make. While your IP is hidden by Tor, Google can and will use these searches to build a behavioral profile.
- **The Biggest Risk: Logging In:** If you log in to _any_ Google account (like Gmail, YouTube, or Drive) in Tor Browser, you have **completely de-anonymized yourself**. You are telling Google, "Here is my exact identity, and here is all the browsing I am doing on this 'anonymous' browser." This connects your real-world identity directly to your Tor activity, defeating the main purpose of the browser.

In short, changing your search engine to Google is a user setting, but it fundamentally undermines the privacy protections that Tor Browser is designed to provide.

This video demonstrates the simple steps for changing the search engine in the Tor Browser's settings menu.

no Add search engines button

---

You are absolutely right. My apologies, the "Add search engines" button is not present in Tor Browser. This is a deliberate security feature to prevent adding extensions that could compromise your anonymity.

There is a different, simple way to add it. You first have to "discover" the search engine by using it.

### How to Add Google as a Search Engine

1.  Navigate to `https://www.google.com` in the Tor Browser address bar.
2.  Perform any search directly on the Google homepage.
3.  Now, go back to the Tor Browser settings:
    - Click the **menu button** (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner.
    - Select **Settings**.
    - Click **Search** on the left.
4.  Under the **Default Search Engine** dropdown menu, **Google** will now appear as an option. You can select it.

You can also try this:

1.  Go to `https://www.google.com`.
2.  **Right-click** inside the address bar (where you see `https://www.google.com`).
3.  You should see an option that says **"Add 'Google'"** or similar. Click it.

After doing either of these, "Google" will be available in your list of search engines, and you can set it as your default.

### Final Privacy Warning

I must repeat: doing this is **strongly discouraged** by the privacy and security community.

- Tor Browser's default search engine, DuckDuckGo, is chosen because it **does not create a profile of you.**
- The moment you start searching on Google, **you are voluntarily sending every search query to Google's servers,** which will log them and build a profile of your interests.
- If you _ever_ sign in to a Google account, you have completely connected your real identity to your "anonymous" Tor session, which defeats the entire purpose of using Tor.

# 1.4 3

Under the Default Search Engine dropdown menu, Google will now appear as an option. You can select it. not true

---

You are correct, and I apologize for providing outdated or incorrect information. Tor Browser, being a highly customized version of Firefox, handles search engines much more restrictively to protect user anonymity, and the standard Firefox method of "discovering" new engines often doesn't work for them.

Since the ability to add new search engines via the UI has been removed or severely limited in recent Tor Browser versions, especially for popular, non-privacy-focused engines like Google, the simplest method remaining is to use **Keyword Bookmarks**.

This method lets you search Google directly from the address bar without needing it in the default search dropdown menu.

### Workaround: Using a Keyword Bookmark

This works in Tor Browser because it is a core Firefox feature that is difficult to disable completely, and it lets you create your own "search engine" shortcut.

1.  **Get the Search URL:**
    - Go to `https://www.google.com`.
    - Search for a unique word, like **`testsearchquery`**.
    - Look at the URL in the address bar after the search. It should look something like this (it might be very long):
      `https://www.google.com/search?q=testsearchquery&...`
2.  **Create the Bookmark:**

    - Copy the URL, but replace your unique search term (`testsearchquery`) with the placeholder **`%s`**.
      - **Example URL to use:** `https://www.google.com/search?q=%s`
    - Press **Ctrl+D** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+D** (macOS) to bookmark the current page.
    - In the bookmark editor that pops up, fill out the details:
      - **Name:** Google
      - **Location/URL:** Paste the modified URL (e.g., `https://www.google.com/search?q=%s`)
      - **Keyword:** Type a short, easy keyword, like **`g`**

3.  **Search Using the Keyword:**
    - In the Tor Browser address bar, type your keyword, a space, and then your search query.
    - **Example:** Type **`g my secret search`** and press Enter.

This will automatically redirect your query to Google, using the Tor network, without needing to set it as the default engine in the settings.

---

### Why Google Does Not Appear as a Default

Tor Browser is specifically configured to limit the number of available search engines to reduce the likelihood of a privacy leak, a concept called **fingerprinting**. The officially included search options (like DuckDuckGo and Startpage) are vetted for use over Tor.

Furthermore, Google and other major search providers actively block or present Captchas to most Tor traffic because they are unable to properly track and profile the anonymous users, leading them to treat all Tor users as potential bots.

# 1.4 4

g my secret search not working. searched in duckduckgo instead

---

It sounds like you were trying to use a **keyword bookmark** or perhaps a custom search shortcut in your browser (likely Tor Browser, based on your mention of a "secret search" and DuckDuckGo), and instead of going to the expected site, it performed a search on **DuckDuckGo**.

Here are the most common reasons this happens, especially in a Firefox-based browser like Tor Browser:

1.  **DuckDuckGo is the default search engine for the URL/Address Bar.**
    - In Tor Browser (which is based on Firefox), if you type something into the address bar that isn't a recognized URL (doesn't start with `http://`, `https://`, or have a domain suffix like `.com`, `.org`, `.onion`), it defaults to performing a search using your configured default search engine, which is DuckDuckGo in Tor Browser.
2.  **Your Keyword Bookmark is not working correctly.**
    - **Keyword Bookmarks** (a feature in Firefox/Tor Browser) let you assign a short word (the "keyword") to a bookmark's URL. If the URL has a `%s` in it, typing the keyword and a search term will search that specific site. If the keyword isn't recognized, or if the bookmark/URL is malformed, the browser treats it as a regular search, defaulting to DuckDuckGo.

### How to Check Your Keyword Bookmark

If you're using a keyword bookmark (like typing `g my search term` to search Google):

1.  **Open your Bookmarks Library:**
    - Go to the menu (often the three lines or "hamburger" icon).
    - Find **Bookmarks** $\to$ **Manage Bookmarks** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+B` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+B` on Mac).
2.  **Find the specific Bookmark:**
    - Locate the bookmark you were trying to use (e.g., the one for your "secret search").
3.  **Check the Properties:**
    - Right-click the bookmark and select **Properties**.
    - **Verify the `Keyword` field:** Make sure the short keyword (`g` in the example) is correct.
    - **Verify the `Location` field (URL):** The URL must be correct and typically needs a placeholder like `%s` where your search term should go.
      - **Example for Google:** A common format would be `https://www.google.com/search?q=%s`

If the keyword or URL is missing or incorrect, the browser will likely ignore the bookmark and just search DuckDuckGo. Try deleting and recreating the keyword bookmark to ensure it's saved correctly.

# 1.4 5

it's correct. but still not working

---

I understand that the keyword for your bookmark is correct, but the feature is still not working in your browser's address bar. This is a common issue, particularly in Firefox-based browsers like Tor Browser.

Since you confirmed the bookmark properties are correct, here are a few other common troubleshooting steps for this specific issue:

1.  **Check `keyword.enabled` in `about:config` (For Firefox/Tor Browser):**
    The keyword search functionality is controlled by a hidden setting. It might have been accidentally disabled or changed by an update/add-on.

    - Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.
    - Accept the risk/warning (if you are prompted).
    - In the search box, type `keyword.enabled`.
    - Make sure its **Value** is set to **`true`**. If it's `false`, double-click the preference or use the toggle button to set it to `true`.

2.  **Verify `keyword.URL` in `about:config` (Less Common):**
    This preference defines the URL template used for keyword searches that aren't tied to a specific bookmark keyword. If it's blank or pointing to a broken URL, that could interfere.

    - In `about:config`, search for `keyword.URL`.
    - It should typically be set to your default search engine's query URL, e.g., something like `google.com/search?q=` (though it might be blank in recent versions, which is usually fine if `keyword.enabled` is `true`). If you see a suspicious or incorrect URL, you can try resetting the preference by right-clicking it and choosing **Reset**.

3.  **Check for Interference from Security/Antivirus Software:**
    Sometimes, security suites (like Avast, Kaspersky, etc.) can interfere with browser files, especially in Tor Browser, which is a modified version of Firefox.

    - If you have a strict antivirus or firewall, you could try temporarily disabling its shields/real-time scanning (or specifically its "Ransomware Shield" or "Safe Browsing" features) to see if the keyword search starts working. If it does, you'll need to create an exception for the browser's executable file (often `firefox.exe` or similar in the Tor Browser folder).

4.  **Test in a New/Safe Profile:**
    A corrupted profile or a conflicting add-on could be the cause.

    - **In Firefox:** Try starting Firefox in [Troubleshoot Mode (formerly Safe Mode)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/diagnose-firefox-issues-using-troubleshoot-mode). This disables extensions and themes. If the keyword works, an add-on is the problem.
    - **In Tor Browser:** Close Tor Browser, find the folder where it's installed, and run the `start-tor-browser.exe` (or equivalent) with the `--safe-mode` argument if available, or try simply running it. Tor's troubleshooting is usually simpler and focused on the first three steps.

**Which browser are you using (Tor, standard Firefox, or something else)?** Knowing the exact browser can help narrow down the most likely solution.

# 1.4 6

it's my fault. i considered name as keyword before. it worked now.

---

That's excellent news! I'm glad you figured it out and it's working now.

It's a very easy mistake to make, as the fields are so similar in the bookmark properties window.

Just to clarify for anyone else reading this, the correct fields in the bookmark properties are:

- **Name:** (The visible title of the bookmark)
- **Location/URL:** (The actual web address, including `%s` where the search term goes)
- **Keyword:** (The short key you type in the address bar to trigger the search)

Happy browsing!

# 1.4 7

but i want it to be default. no need to type g ...

---

You are absolutely right. If you want a specific search engine to run when you type anything that's _not_ a URL (and without using a keyword like `g` or `w`), you need to set it as your **Default Search Engine**.

This is the standard way to change where your address bar searches by default in browsers like Firefox and Tor Browser.

Here is the step-by-step guide for **Firefox / Tor Browser**:

1.  **Open Settings:** Click the **Menu button** (the three horizontal lines, often called the "hamburger menu") in the top right corner.
2.  Select **Settings**.
3.  In the left sidebar, click the **Search** tab (it has a magnifying glass icon).
4.  Look for the section titled **"Default Search Engine."**
5.  Click the dropdown menu under this heading and select the search engine you want to use for all your non-keyword searches.

### If your preferred engine is NOT in the list:

If you're trying to use a very specific or custom search engine (like your local weather service, a private instance, or a new site), you need to **add it to the list of available search engines** first.

There are two main ways to do this:

#### 1. The Easy Way (Right-Click)

- Go to the search engine's homepage (e.g., a specific dictionary site or a forum).
- **Right-click** on the search box on that website.
- Look for an option like **"Add a Keyword for this Search"** or **"Add Search Engine."**
- Follow the prompts to add it. You can skip adding a keyword since you want it to be your default.

#### 2. The Manual Way (For Advanced Users)

- If the site doesn't offer the easy right-click option, you can manually create the search engine and set it as your default.
- You'll need an Add-on like **Add custom search engine** (you'll have to search for this in the Firefox Add-ons store).
- Once added, you can manually enter the search URL for your custom site (using `%s` in place of the search term) and then select it in the Default Search Engine settings.

Once your preferred search engine is set as the **Default Search Engine**, you will no longer need to type a keyword for it to work from the address bar.
