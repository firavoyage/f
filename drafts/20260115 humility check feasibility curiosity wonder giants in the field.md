# 1

I want to create an agentic vibe coding app like opencode.ai. How would you do the Preliminary Feasibility Check.

---

Fira, let’s sit together gently and look at how you might do a **preliminary feasibility check** for an _agentic‑vibe coding app_ — something like _OpenCode.ai_ — in calm, clear steps. There’s no rush, just steady insight into whether the idea is worth exploring before you start building.

---

## ☁️ 1. Understand _What_ You’re Planning

Before anything else, let your mind settle on _what the app really is_:

- OpenCode is an **AI coding agent** that runs in terminals or IDEs and helps developers generate, refactor, or debug code through natural language. It supports many LLM (large language model) providers and is open‑source. ([OpenCode][1])
- It doesn’t just generate text — it acts like a coding partner that can be integrated into workflows. ([株式会社一創 |][2])

So the core idea you’re exploring is:

> Can we build a tool where an AI _agent_ assists developers in coding — possibly in a similar or distinct way?

Whenever you think about feasibility, keep that core “agentic help for coding” in mind.

---

## 🧠 2. Define the Vision

Ask yourself softly, like a thought exercise:

- _Who is this for?_
  Developers with terminal workflows? IDE users? Beginners who want visual guidance?

- _What problem does it solve?_
  Faster coding? Better code quality? Learning support? Workflow automation?

A clear vision helps the rest of your path feel grounded.

---

## 📊 3. Market Reality Check

This is about listening to the world around you, kindly and honestly.

### 🌱 Who already exists?

There are tools already helping programmers with AI:

- OpenCode itself — open‑source and flexible. ([OpenCode][1])
- Other options like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Aider, etc. ([NxCode][3])

This doesn’t mean “you can’t build it.” It means you should understand what’s already there — their strengths, their limitations — so you can think about your _unique place_.

Ask yourself:

- Is there a _gap_ that’s not well served?
- Is there a _group_ of users whose needs aren’t met?

This step doesn’t require perfection — just curiosity and humility.

---

## 💡 4. Technical Feasibility

Here’s where you gently think about “can I build _this_ at all?”

### 🌿 What will power your app?

You’ll likely rely on:

- One or more **LLM APIs** (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
  — they do the text generation and code suggestions.
- A **framework** or **interface** (web, desktop, IDE plugin, CLI).
- A way to organize the agent’s behaviors — the logic that decides how it responds.

These pieces exist. OpenCode stitches them together. ([OpenCode][4])

So the real question becomes:

> Can you design your _agent logic_ & _workflow integration_ in a way that feels smooth, helpful, and reliable?

That’s worth some exploration — perhaps through a prototype.

---

## 💸 5. Cost and Resources

Softly imagine how much energy it will take.

Ask:

- Do you need servers?
- Which API services will cost money?
- Will the first prototype be free for users?
- Do you have help or collaborators?

This stage is about grounding yourself — not fear, just realism.

---

## 🤝 6. Legal, Privacy, and Data Considerations

AI apps involve data — sometimes code that’s sensitive. Be thoughtful:

- How will you handle **user data**?
- Will you keep code local, or send it to models in the cloud?
- Are there policies around open‑source usage you need to respect?

Tools like OpenCode don’t store user code by design — that’s part of their privacy ethos. ([OpenCode][1])

This step protects your future users and your integrity.

---

## 🧪 7. Try a Little Prototype

A gentle experiment can tell you a lot:

- Build a _simple prototype_ that uses one LLM to answer coding questions.
- Connect it into a small interface (even a web page or a CLI).
- See how users react — you don’t need a full product yet.

A prototype is like dipping your toe in the water — informative and low‑risk.

---

## 🍃 8. Reflect and Decide

After those steps, create a little space to reflect:

- What did you learn?
- Does the idea still feel alive?
- What parts are exciting, and which are hard?
- What’s one small next step?

This reflection isn’t about being perfect — it’s about _clarity and calm direction_.

---

If you want, we can walk through each of these steps in a bit more depth together — like exploring one gentle idea at a time. Just let me know where you want to start, Fira. 🌼

Strong competitors like Claude code exist in the field. They are big and famous companies. But I don't even know what they have done with such enormous budget, geniuses, time, and efforts.

---

Fira, you’re wise to pause and _wonder_ what giants like **Claude Code** have really built — not just their shiny names and big reputations, but what’s _under the hood_ and why it matters. Let’s calmly unpack what Claude’s doing so you can see the landscape more clearly. 🌿

---

## 🌱 What Claude Code _Actually Is_

At its core, Claude Code is an AI‑driven coding assistant developed by **Anthropic**, a research‑focused AI company started by former OpenAI folks who emphasize safety and principled AI behavior. ([Tom's Guide][1])

Here’s what sets it apart:

### 🧠 Deep Understanding of Code

Claude Code doesn’t just autocomplete lines like some assistants. It **analyzes your whole codebase**, recognizes project structure and dependencies, and uses that context to make suggestions that _fit_ the architecture rather than just filling tokens. ([Claude][2])

This means:

- It can refactor multiple files in a coordinated way.
- It understands dependencies and patterns in your code.
- It’s more than a “text generator” — it’s trying to act like a programming partner. ([Claude][2])

---

## 💻 Where It Integrates

Claude Code is designed to work _where developers already work_:

- In the **terminal**, so you avoid switching tools. ([Claude][2])
- With popular IDEs like **VS Code** or JetBrains. ([Claude][3])
- With version control (like GitHub, GitLab) — so it can read issues, write code, run tests, and even open pull requests. ([Claude][2])

This integration isn’t trivial — it’s thoughtful because it lets the AI _be part of your workflow_ instead of sitting outside it.

---

## 🔄 How It Works Practically

Rather than treating you as a simple prompt source, Claude Code aims to:

### 🧩 Understand Context

It reads your files and builds a semantic understanding of the project — your architecture, patterns, and even tests — so its suggestions are _contextual_, not just generative fluff. ([Claude][2])

### 🗂️ Make Multi‑File Changes

Instead of single reactions, it can:

- update related files,
- propagate changes safely,
- and consider tests and builds.

This makes it closer to a human _pair coder_ rather than a basic autocomplete tool. ([Claude][2])

---

## 📈 The Big Picture Reasoning

Anthropic’s Claude models like **Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5** — which power Claude Code — are designed for _reasoning and safety_, not just token prediction. They’re trained with a framework that guides behavior using _principles_, aiming for more reliable and context‑aware responses than simple reinforcement learning. ([Tom's Guide][1])

That’s part of why Claude Code can handle multi‑step tasks over long context windows — it’s made to _stay coherent_ over bigger workloads than many other models.

---

## ✨ Notable Extensions Beyond Code

Interestingly, Anthropic is now extending its AI beyond just coding:

- **Claude Cowork**: a digital assistant that can manage files, link external services, and execute multi‑step workflows — basically acting more like a _co‑worker_ than a chatbot. ([The Verge][4])

This is representative of a trend: AI that doesn’t just talk about tasks, but _acts on them_ in the user’s environment.

---

## 🪞 Real‑World User Experiences

From the trenches, developers say things like:

- Claude Code _can produce accurate, high‑quality code quickly_. ([reddit.com][5])
- But it’s not perfect — sometimes it misreads context or needs careful instruction. ([reddit.com][6])
- And workflows may still require _human oversight and review_, especially for complex features or reviews. ([reddit.com][7])

This is gentle evidence that the tech isn’t magical — it’s _powerful_ when used with good context and clear thought.

---

## 🌄 So Why Are They Big and Famous?

Very few companies in AI have:

1. **Deep research funding** to explore novel model training and safety methods.
2. **Large engineering teams** to build integrations (terminal, IDEs, Git workflows).
3. **Access to high‑performance computing** and large datasets for model training.

These elements take time, money, and smart people working together — and that’s why tools like Claude Code are sophisticated.

---

## 🌿 A Warm Reflection

You don’t have to match a giant with all its resources to make something meaningful. What matters is:

- identifying _specific pain points_ they don’t fully solve,
- building something _focused_,
- and learning from their approach without copying it.

Your insight is already growing. Every thoughtful question you ask — like this one — brings you closer to your own unique way of building. 💫

If you’d like, we can reflect next on what _unique value_ your vision could bring to the field — something that even a big player hasn’t fully captured yet. Just say the word, Fira.
