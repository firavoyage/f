my ubuntu is out of memory after several days of uptime. it could be fixed by regular restart, but i dont wanna do that. after a restart, although i opened the same apps, the memory is quite lower. while ubuntu does not have a decent sandbox, when the maximum memory is reached, sometimes my mouse can not move, sometimes it closes all apps.

This is a common issue with Linux systems where memory isn't being properly reclaimed over time. Here are several solutions to try without restarting:

## Immediate Fixes

**Clear cached memory:**

```bash
sudo sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```

This clears pagecache, dentries, and inodes without affecting running applications.

**Clear swap:**

```bash
sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a
```

This clears and recreates swap space.

## Long-term Solutions

### 1. Adjust VM Settings

Add to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```bash
# More aggressive memory reclaim
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=500
vm.swappiness=10
vm.dirty_ratio=15
vm.dirty_background_ratio=5

# Apply immediately
sudo sysctl -p
```

### 2. Install Early OOM

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install earlyoom
sudo systemctl enable earlyoom
sudo systemctl start earlyoom
```

Early OOM kills processes before the system becomes completely unresponsive.

### 3. Memory Monitoring Script

Create a script to automatically clear caches when memory gets low:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as /usr/local/bin/memory-manager

THRESHOLD=85
CURRENT=$(free | grep Mem | awk '{print $3/$2 * 100.0}')

if (( $(echo "$CURRENT > $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
    sync
    echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
    logger "Auto-cleared memory caches at ${CURRENT}% usage"
fi
```

Make it executable and add to cron:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/memory-manager
sudo crontab -e
# Add: */10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/memory-manager
```

### 4. Identify Memory Leaks

```bash
# Monitor memory usage by process
sudo apt install smem
smem -s rss -r

# Check for memory leaks
sudo apt install valgrind

# Monitor over time
watch -n 5 'free -h; echo; ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10'
```

### 5. Application-specific Solutions

**For browsers:**

- Use extensions like "The Great Suspender" for Chrome
- Limit tabs and use bookmark sessions
- Restart browser periodically instead of whole system

**Use systemd services:**

```bash
# Create a service to restart problematic apps daily
sudo systemctl edit --force --full memory-hog-app.service
```

### 6. Alternative: Use ZRAM

```bash
sudo apt install zram-config
sudo service zram-config restart
```

ZRAM compresses memory in RAM, effectively increasing available memory.

## Monitoring Tools

**Install htop for better process monitoring:**

```bash
sudo apt install htop
htop
```

**Use GNOME System Monitor:**

```bash
gnome-system-monitor
```

## Quick Status Check

```bash
# Check current memory status
free -h
cat /proc/meminfo

# Check what's using memory
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10

# Check for memory leaks
cat /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure
```

The combination of adjusting VM settings, installing Early OOM, and setting up periodic cache clearing should significantly reduce your memory issues without requiring regular restarts. Start with the VM settings and Early OOM, as these provide the most immediate benefit.

after running some of these scripts, my swap increased from 2gb to 10gb. what's the magic. can i get more memory?

---

Great question! You've discovered one of the "magic" tricks of Linux memory management. Let me explain what happened and how you can leverage this:

## What Happened with Your Swap?

When you ran those commands, you likely triggered more aggressive memory reclamation. The system started moving inactive memory pages from RAM to swap, which is actually **good** - it's your system working smarter, not harder.

## The "Magic" - How Linux Memory Management Works

Linux has several tricks to effectively increase available memory:

### 1. **ZRAM (Compressed RAM in RAM)**

This is likely what increased your "swap" to 10GB. ZRAM creates a compressed block device in RAM that acts as swap. Since compression typically gives you 2-3x more space, you effectively get more memory.

```bash
# Check if ZRAM is enabled
sudo zramctl
cat /proc/swaps

# Install/enable ZRAM if not present
sudo apt install zram-config
sudo systemctl enable zram-config
```

### 2. **Actual Memory Expansion Options**

**Increase ZRAM size:**

```bash
# Check current ZRAM size
cat /sys/block/zram0/disksize

# Temporarily increase (example: 16GB ZRAM)
echo 16G | sudo tee /sys/block/zram0/disksize
sudo swapoff /dev/zram0
sudo swapon /dev/zram0
```

**Add more swap file:**

```bash
# Create additional 4GB swap file
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile2
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile2
sudo mkswap /swapfile2
sudo swapon /swapfile2

# Make permanent by adding to /etc/fstab:
echo '/swapfile2 none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

## Check Your Current Memory Status

```bash
# Detailed memory info
free -h
sudo zramctl
cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i swap
lsblk

# Check what type of swap you have
swapon --show
```

## Can You Get More "Real" Memory?

**Software solutions (what you're already doing):**

- ✅ ZRAM compression = 2-3x effective memory
- ✅ Better swap management
- ✅ Memory deduplication (KSM)

**Hardware solutions:**

- Add more physical RAM
- Use faster SSD for swap (NVMe)

## Optimize Your Current Setup

**Fine-tune ZRAM:**

```bash
# Edit ZRAM configuration
sudo nano /etc/default/zram-config
# Change:
# ALGO=lz4 (fastest compression)
# PERCENT=200 (compressed size can be 2x RAM)
```

**Better compression algorithm:**

```bash
# Check available algorithms
cat /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm
# lzo lzo-rle lz4 lz4hc 842 [lzo-rle]

# Change to lz4 (usually best balance)
echo lz4 | sudo tee /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm
```

## Monitor the Effectiveness

```bash
# Watch ZRAM effectiveness
watch -n 2 'zramctl; echo; free -h; echo; cat /proc/swaps'

# Check compression ratio
cat /sys/block/zram0/mm_stat
```

## Quick Performance Check

```bash
# Test if system feels responsive
time ls -la /usr/bin

# Check system responsiveness under load
sudo apt install stress
stress --vm 2 --vm-bytes 1G --timeout 30s
```

## The Reality Check

While ZRAM gives you **more effective memory**, it does use some CPU for compression. For most modern systems, this is an excellent trade-off.

**Your 10GB "swap" is likely:**

- 4-5GB of actual RAM compressed to appear as 10GB
- Much faster than disk-based swap
- Why your system feels like it has more memory

## Final Recommendation

Stick with your current setup! The increased swap usage is actually a **good sign** - it means your system is efficiently using ZRAM compression to give you more usable memory without the cost of physical RAM upgrades.

The "magic" is Linux's sophisticated memory compression and management working exactly as designed!

how to get more swap.

---

Here are several ways to increase your swap space:

## Method 1: Create a New Swap File (Recommended)

**Check current swap:**

```bash
swapon --show
free -h
```

**Create a new swap file (8GB example):**

```bash
# Create the file (adjust size as needed)
sudo fallocate -l 8G /swapfile

# If fallocate doesn't work, use dd:
# sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=8192

# Set secure permissions
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

# Set up as swap space
sudo mkswap /swapfile

# Enable immediately
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

**Make it permanent:**

```bash
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

## Method 2: Resize Existing Swap File

**If you already have a swapfile:**

```bash
# Turn off current swap
sudo swapoff /swapfile

# Resize the file (to 16GB example)
sudo fallocate -l 16G /swapfile

# Recreate swap
sudo mkswap /swapfile

# Turn back on
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

## Method 3: Multiple Swap Files

**Create additional swap files:**

```bash
# Create second swap file
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile2
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile2
sudo mkswap /swapfile2
sudo swapon /swapfile2

# Create third swap file
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile3
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile3
sudo mkswap /swapfile3
sudo swapon /swapfile3

# Add to fstab
echo '/swapfile2 none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
echo '/swapfile3 none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

## Method 4: Use ZRAM for Compressed Swap

**Install and configure ZRAM:**

```bash
sudo apt install zram-config

# Check current ZRAM size
cat /sys/block/zram0/disksize

# Increase ZRAM size (to 16GB example)
echo 16G | sudo tee /sys/block/zram0/disksize
sudo swapoff /dev/zram0
sudo mkswap /dev/zram0
sudo swapon /dev/zram0
```

## Method 5: Dedicated Swap Partition

**If you have free disk space:**

```bash
# Create new partition using fdisk/parted
sudo fdisk /dev/sdX  # Replace with your disk

# Format as swap
sudo mkswap /dev/sdXN  # Replace with new partition

# Enable
sudo swapon /dev/sdXN

# Add to fstab
echo '/dev/sdXN none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

## Verify Your New Swap

```bash
# Check all swap spaces
swapon --show
free -h
cat /proc/swaps

# Check disk space for swap files
df -h /swapfile*
```

## Optimize Swap Settings

**Edit /etc/sysctl.conf:**

```bash
# Better swap management
vm.swappiness=30           # How aggressively to use swap (0-100)
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50   # How aggressively to reclaim cache
vm.dirty_ratio=15          # When to write dirty pages to disk
vm.dirty_background_ratio=5

# Apply changes
sudo sysctl -p
```

## Quick One-Liner for Maximum Swap

**Want to go all out? Create 32GB total swap:**

```bash
# Create multiple swap files totaling 32GB
for i in {1..4}; do
    sudo fallocate -l 8G /swapfile$i
    sudo chmod 600 /swapfile$i
    sudo mkswap /swapfile$i
    sudo swapon /swapfile$i
    echo "/swapfile$i none swap sw 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
done
```

## Performance Considerations

**Swap priority (if using multiple):**

```bash
# Set priorities (higher number = used first)
sudo swapon -p 100 /swapfile
sudo swapon -p 50 /swapfile2

# In fstab: /swapfile none swap sw,pri=100 0 0
```

**SSD vs HDD:**

- **SSD**: Can safely use larger swap (16GB+)
- **HDD**: Keep swap smaller (4-8GB) to avoid performance issues

## Check What's Actually Using Swap

```bash
# See which processes are using swap
sudo smem -s swap -r

# Monitor swap usage in real-time
watch -n 2 'free -h; echo; swapon --show'
```

## Recommended Approach

For most systems, I recommend:

1. **Method 1** - Create a single 8-16GB swap file
2. **Method 4** - Enable ZRAM for additional compressed swap
3. **Combine both** for maximum effective memory

This gives you the speed of ZRAM with the capacity of disk-based swap.

**Quick start (8GB swap file + ZRAM):**

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 8G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

sudo apt install zram-config
sudo service zram-config restart
```

Your swap should now show significantly more available space!
