("what web games lacks")

how could i make visuals (web apps, games, videos scenes, posters, etc.) more graceful, practically.

e.g. remove all the text (or replace with big words, icons, ...) categorized.

(ask for the question first.)

not just something that works. (vibe coding blue to purple gradients)

---

data driven. Fuck that dream.

how.

---

mcp, lsp.

what is. how to create one.

---

ctf. (i mean, ...)

userscript (browser extension) for exporting.

dom, and network.

how to get and pass the network infomation.

---

things like https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/frontend-design/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md

are everywhere.

find and organize them.

---

intuitive project: python.

(i love cpp more... or rust?)

but, nothing special. (scratch is ofc deprecated, good design, good library, but too opinionated about the interaction.)

(agentic) llms could work anyway, although.

---

todo

<!-- leverage thinking. -->

---

journal:

~~the magic move.~~

design api: proceed as long as safe (what's safe... like not irreversible), let frontend take the responsibility.

ui. clarity (simple). write. (how to be elegant. "web games often lack. vibe coded apps often lack.")

---

carte:

game design.

gameplay.

ideas.

clarity.

---

carte: a build step or not

---

journal: journal.md

---

carte: clarify the game. think how to ask. (how to ask how to ask)

---

(cursor claude code alternatives)

learn from manus. (how, what do i want, and what may i ask)

i dont need automation. i dont need create my own manus. i need a set of prompts. yeah, it definitely helps, i think.

i would like to have some prompts. not manus. but claude code. (confirm)

https://manus.im/share/IXdMjxObbFKbIjUUkBk4EH?replay=1

---

journal, mindmap like markdown nested list.

clarify. (summarize/normalize/standardize/...)

before design ui.

---

self. journal. (carte.)

pure.

pure project. (important. appealing.)

---

grow. eat.

---

have one aesthetic appealing idea (no more todo lists). test opencode myself, learning by doing.

have one complex task. test opencode, about the workflow, showcasing its power.

see things myself. sometimes just add some apis to chatgpt, that's enough.

"just find some skills and have some prompts"

that's value:

- proven workflow. good prompts.
- simple automation like self correction loop.

if it works and feels right, then that's it. no need to have infinite power. no need to chase everything.

ai lian shuo. heng sheng teng man pang sheng zhi jin

chinese textbook articles.

categorize apps

"make all (existing) useful tools elegant"

categorize world's infomation

"organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful"

---

voice input.

"be graceful"

---

para. (supporting grow)

---

give me some words for meta thinking.

---

revise projects... more pragmatic?

---

summary style...

---

Humility ai.

E.g. self correction. Remove responding and guiding. Check the question. Category: correctness, simplicity and clarity, ...

Let opencode don't write code. Bark. Argue me. Do weird things.

---

Perspective like archi

---

Design UI in text?

---

search some blogposts of well known software engineers using claude code.

---

categorize verbs.
another general question:

vibe coding suggestions. mindmap.

(llms are stupid/mediocity. most people are wrong. that's the problem, and maybe the only problem.)

---

give zsh fish power ex: zsh-autosuggestions feels stupid.

---

find in indian/kenyan within 10 minutes online. ordinary people. contact them.

---

organize physical scratch pad.

---

revise chatgpt copy userscript. first time scroll throught without copy. second copy do the real work.

(fix "you said...")

---

downloads/g

phone

---

organize things.

- all
- things
- projects
- physical notebook
- ...
