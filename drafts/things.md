("what web games lacks")

how could i make visuals (web apps, games, videos scenes, posters, etc.) more graceful, practically.

e.g. remove all the text (or replace with big words, icons, ...) categorized.

(ask for the question first.)

not just something that works. (vibe coding blue to purple gradients)

data driven. Fuck that dream.

how.

mcp, lsp.

what is. how to create one.

---

ctf. (i mean, ...)

userscript (browser extension) for exporting.

dom, and network.

how to get and pass the network infomation.

things like https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/frontend-design/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md

are everywhere.

find and organize them.

intuitive project: python.

(i love cpp more... or rust?)

but, nothing special. (scratch is ofc deprecated, good design, good library, but too opinionated about the interaction.)

(agentic) llms could work anyway, although.
