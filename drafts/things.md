("what web games lacks")

how could i make visuals (web apps, games, videos scenes, posters, etc.) more graceful, practically.

e.g. remove all the text (or replace with big words, icons, ...) categorized.

(ask for the question first.)

not just something that works. (vibe coding blue to purple gradients)
