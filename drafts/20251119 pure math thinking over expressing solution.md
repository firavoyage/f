how to create math videos, i feel hard using the formal wording of clarity and simplicity, rely on simple words a lot, which is verbose and does not feel right, while writing a detailed script is time consuming and boring.

Of course. This is an extremely common and frustrating hurdle. You're caught between the "textbook jargon" that feels stiff and a "rambling explanation" that feels unprofessional. The good news is that there's a sweet spot, and it's all about process and mindset.

The problem isn't that you're using simple words; the problem is likely a lack of **structure** before you start speaking.

Let's break down a system that avoids the boring, detailed script but gives you the clarity and confidence of having one.

### The Core Mindshift: Stop "Writing a Script." Start "Structuring an Explanation."

A script feels like a novel. An explanation is a map. You're just plotting the key landmarks so you don't get lost. This is faster and feels more natural.

### The Practical System: The "Landmark & Talk" Method

This method sits between a full script and zero preparation. It's the key to being both clear and efficient.

**Step 1: Define the ONE Thing**
Before anything else, finish this sentence: "By the end of this video, my viewer will be able to **\_\_\_\_**."

- **Bad:** "Learn about quadratic equations."
- **Good:** "Solve a quadratic equation using the factoring method."
- **Better:** "Solve a quadratic equation in the form `ax² + bx + c` when `a=1`."

This is your North Star. Every part of your video must serve this goal.

**Step 2: Create a Visual Outline (The "Landmarks")**
Instead of writing sentences, create a bullet-point list of the **visual and conceptual steps**. This is your storyboard and script outline combined.

**Example: Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring**

1.  **VISUAL:** Title Slide - "Solving Quadratics by Factoring: A Simple Guide"
2.  **CONCEPT:** The Big Idea - "We're turning `ax² + bx + c = 0` into `(x + p)(x + q) = 0`."
3.  **VISUAL:** Show a simple example: `x² + 5x + 6 = 0`
4.  **CONCEPT:** Step 1 - Find two numbers that multiply to 6 (c) and add to 5 (b). (Highlight 2 and 3).
5.  **VISUAL:** Animate writing the factors: `(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0`
6.  **CONCEPT:** Step 2 - Use the Zero Product Property. If A\*B=0, then A=0 or B=0.
7.  **VISUAL:** Show the two small equations: `x + 2 = 0` and `x + 3 = 0`
8.  **CONCEPT:** Step 3 - Solve for x. (Circle the answers: `x = -2, -3`)
9.  **VISUAL:** Final Summary Slide with the 3 steps.

This outline took 5 minutes. You now have a perfect roadmap.

**Step 3: Record Your Audio "Live"**
Now, with your outline in front of you, open your recording software (OBS, iPad screen recorder, etc.) and just start talking through each point.

- **Look at your first landmark:** "The Big Idea..."
- **Now talk to your viewer as if they're in the room with you:** _"Okay, so the whole goal of factoring is to take this messy quadratic equation and twist it into something much friendlier: a multiplication of two brackets set to zero. It looks like magic, but it's just a clever trick."_
- **Then move to the next landmark and do the same.**

**Why this works:**

- **It's a conversation, not a recitation.** Your language will naturally be simpler and more direct.
- **It embraces pauses and "umms".** You can edit these out later. The flow of thought is more important.
- **It's fast.** If you mess up a sentence, you just pause and say it again. You can edit the bad take out.

### How to Fix the "Wording" Problem Directly

You feel "verbose" because you're figuring out the idea _while_ you're explaining it. The structure above fixes 80% of that. For the remaining 20%, use these techniques:

1.  **Use Analogies and Metaphors:** This is your most powerful tool.

    - **Instead of:** "We isolate the variable to one side of the equation."
    - **Try:** "Think of the equation like a balance scale. Whatever you do to one side, you _must_ do to the other to keep it balanced. So if we want to get `x` by itself, we need to clean up the mess around it."

2.  **Practice the "One-Sentence Summary":** For each key concept, force yourself to explain it in a single, simple sentence.

    - **Concept:** The Pythagorean Theorem.
    - **One-Sentence:** "For any right triangle, the area of the square on the long side is equal to the combined area of the squares on the other two sides." (Then visually show this!).

3.  **Script _Only_ the Complex Definitions:** You don't need to script everything. If there's a specific, precise term you _must_ use (e.g., "the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle"), write that _one sentence_ down and read it verbatim. Then go back to casual explaining.

### Your New Workflow Summary

1.  **Pick a Micro-Topic:** (5 min) "How to find the slope of a line."
2.  **Build a Landmark Outline:** (10 min) List the 5-7 visual/conceptual steps.
3.  **Gather Assets:** (5 min) Have your digital whiteboard/tablet/paper ready.
4.  **Record & Talk:** (15 min) Record your screen and audio as you talk through your landmarks. Don't fear mistakes; just pause and continue.
5.  **Edit (The Magic Fix):** (20-30 min) This is where you become concise.
    - Cut out all the "umms," long pauses, and verbal stumbles.
    - Speed up sections where you are drawing/writing silently.
    - Add visuals, text callouts, and music in these gaps.

The editing process is what transforms your natural, slightly verbose speech into a tight, professional-looking video. The initial recording just needs to have the **correct heart and content**.

You are not a news anchor reading a teleprompter. You are a guide explaining a path. Embrace the slightly informal, conversational tone—that's what makes math videos on YouTube so successful! The clarity comes from your structure, not from your vocabulary.
