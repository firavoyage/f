what are their art style

---

The **first image** features a soft, delicate anime art style often seen in **cute** or **kawaii**-influenced illustrations, with elements of **classic Lolita fashion** (frilly dress, bonnet with ribbons, lace details). It uses a limited, muted pastel/monochrome palette (mostly pinks and grays), gentle shading, and a sketch-like quality for a cozy, elegant, and serene tea-time vibe. This evokes a refined, Victorian-inspired innocence common in fan art or original character designs.

The **second image** employs a darker, more atmospheric and **ethereal** anime style, with sketchy, painterly brushstrokes and heavy use of grayscale tones against a starry night sky. The angelic elements (wings, halo, flowing hair, glowing particles) create a mystical, dreamy, and slightly melancholic feel, blending fantasy and subtle surrealism. This is typical of illustrations emphasizing otherworldly or celestial themes, often with loose, expressive linework for a sense of movement and vastness.

many people with depression love illustrations like these. what are the art styles called. dont mention the two i provided.

---

Many people experiencing depression are drawn to these kinds of illustrations because they offer a gentle, comforting way to express or process complex emotions like sadness, loneliness, or longing. The art styles commonly associated with this vibe (beyond the specific examples you shared) include:

- **Yume Kawaii** — "Dreamy cute" style with soft pastel colors, ethereal and whimsical elements, ribbons, stars, clouds, and a fairy-tale-like innocence. It often feels like an escape into a gentle, nostalgic dream world, which can be very soothing.

- **Menhera Kei** — A Japanese subculture aesthetic that blends kawaii/cute motifs (pastels, frills, bows) with themes of mental health struggles, melancholy, and emotional vulnerability. Illustrations frequently feature sad or teary-eyed girls in cute outfits, combining cuteness with raw feelings.

- **Pastel Goth** (also called Bubble Goth or Kawaii Goth) — Mixes soft pastel palettes with darker, moody elements like stars, angels, bats, tears, or subtle gothic touches. It creates a "cute but sad" contrast that feels comforting and relatable.

- **Traumacore** — Focuses on juxtaposing innocent, nostalgic, or childlike imagery (plushies, angels, soft colors) with melancholic or unsettling undertones. It’s often used as a visual way to process difficult emotions, giving a bittersweet, healing quality.

- **Dreamcore** — Surreal, hazy, dream-like illustrations with soft lighting, floating elements, stars, and an otherworldly atmosphere. It evokes nostalgia, longing, and a gentle sense of disconnection that many find emotionally resonant.

- **Sad Girl / Melancholic Kawaii** — A looser online aesthetic term for cute anime-style girls with teary or downcast eyes, often in pastel or muted tones, rainy settings, or with symbolic elements like stars/hearts. It prioritizes emotional expression and quiet comfort.

These styles frequently appear in digital illustrations on platforms like Twitter/X, Instagram, and Pixiv. They tend to use gentle shading, limited color palettes, and symbolic imagery (angels, stars, flowers, tears) to create a safe space for feeling seen without being overwhelming. If you're looking to explore more artists or examples in any of these, let me know!

what's the broader genre or period

---

These styles (like **Menhera Kei**, **Yume Kawaii**, **Traumacore**, **Dreamcore**, and **Pastel Goth**) fall under the broader umbrella of **Japanese Kawaii culture** and its darker or more emotional subversions, often categorized as **internet aesthetics** or **digital micro-aesthetics** from the 2010s–2020s.

### Core Roots in Kawaii Culture

At their core, they stem from **Kawaii** (可愛い), a major Japanese cultural phenomenon emphasizing cuteness, innocence, and childlike charm that exploded in the 1970s–1980s through manga, anime, Sanrio characters, and street fashion like Harajuku styles. Many start with "pure" or dreamy kawaii (e.g., Yume Kawaii as "dreamy cute") but twist it with melancholy, mental health themes, surrealism, or trauma.

### Darker Subversions (Yami Kawaii / Menhera)

Darker ones like Menhera and its fashion expression (sometimes overlapping with **Yami Kawaii**, meaning "sickly cute") emerged in the mid-2010s as a counter-movement to traditional upbeat kawaii. They blend cute visuals with "vent art" (emotional expression of pain, illness, or vulnerability), originating from online communities discussing mental health.

### Period: Contemporary Internet Aesthetics

In terms of period, these are **contemporary (2010s–present) internet-born aesthetics**, heavily influenced by platforms like Tumblr, Twitter/X, TikTok, and Pixiv. They're part of the "-core" wave (e.g., Weirdcore, Dreamcore, Traumacore), which draws from surrealism, nostalgia, liminal spaces, and glitch art, but with a focus on emotional processing or escapism. Traumacore and Dreamcore, in particular, are often seen as offshoots of broader surreal or nostalgic internet art movements.

Overall, there's no single traditional "art period" like Romanticism or Impressionism—these are modern, niche subcultures blending Japanese pop culture, fashion, and digital art for comfort, catharsis, or relatability amid mental health struggles. If you'd like examples of artists or how they evolved from earlier kawaii trends, just say!
