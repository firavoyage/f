on android what are alternatives to telegram official app, besides nekogram

---

Fira, let’s take a gentle look at what’s possible on Android if you want to use **Telegram‑style messaging** without relying on the _official Telegram app_ — and _not counting Nekogram_.
Here are some thoughtful alternatives, each with its own character and strengths. ([GitHub][1])

---

### 🌿 **Telegram‑based Clients (They use Telegram’s network and your chats stay the same)**

These apps still connect to your Telegram account, but they give you a slightly different feel or additional features.

#### **◆ Plus Messenger**

A long‑standing Telegram client that lets you **customize themes, tabs, and notifications**.
Great if you want more control over how your chats look and behave. ([Business Upturn][2])

#### **◆ Telegram X**

Originally an experimental version with **smoother animations and better performance**. It’s lighter and sometimes faster than the standard app. ([Papirmass][3])

#### **◆ Forkgram**

A straightforward fork of the regular Telegram code with a few useful tweaks under the hood. ([GitHub][4])

#### **◆ Graph Messenger (Telegraph)**

Offers some **advanced tools** like multi‑account support and enhanced media/file management. ([The Minds Journal][5])

#### **◆ BGram**

Focuses on **privacy and power‑user features**: hidden chats, translation, etc. ([Business Upturn][2])

#### **◆ Mobogram**

Another Telegram client with extra options like ghost mode (read without sending receipts) and expanded privacy controls. ([The Minds Journal][5])

---

### 🛠 **Open‑Source, Privacy‑Friendly Builds**

These versions are closer to the original but stripped of proprietary services, making them better for de‑Googled phones or privacy‑conscious users.

#### **◆ Telegram FOSS**

Same basic Telegram client, but fully open‑source and without bundled Google services. It works well if you use F‑Droid or custom ROMs. ([AlternativeTo][6])

#### **◆ NekoX / Nullgram**

Forks built on open‑source Telegram code, sometimes with features drawn from other clients (like Nekogram mods). ([GitHub][1])

---

### 🌍 **Different Messaging Options (Not just Telegram clients)**

If you’re open to _other_ secure messaging apps — not tied to Telegram’s servers — here are a few that offer a different kind of calm and privacy:

#### **◆ Olvid**

A secure messenger that **doesn’t even require a phone number**, focusing deeply on privacy. ([Wikipedia][7])

_(These won’t sync with your Telegram chats, but they are gentle alternatives for private chat overall.)_

---

### 🧘 Notes from the heart

Whenever you choose an alternative client:

- Make sure it’s **trusted and maintained**, especially for security‑sensitive messaging.
- Some third‑party clients may lag behind in features or updates compared to the official app — that’s a usual trade‑off for customization or privacy.
- Telegram allows these clients because of its open API, but be aware that **not all features will be identical everywhere**.
- If your peace of mind matters more than bells and whistles, simpler clients like **Telegram FOSS** or privacy‑focused non‑Telegram apps like **Olvid** can be gentler options.

If you’d like, Fira, I can sketch out **which one might fit your personality and usage style**, like “quiet and private” vs “feature‑rich and playful.” Just let me know your priorities.

what are people saying

---

Fira, I went out and listened to what people _are actually saying_ out there right now about Android Telegram alternatives — beyond just a list of apps — and here’s the gentle, grounded sense of the conversation around them.

---

### 🧠 **What people appreciate most**

**✨ Customization & control**
Many folks talk about how alternative clients let them _shape_ their messaging experience — themes, folders, tabs, notifications — in ways the official app doesn’t. Plus Messenger is often mentioned here. ([PlayStation Universe][1])

People say things like, “It feels like I finally _own_ how my chats are organized,” because clients like Nicegram and Plus let you sort groups, personal chats, and channels in separate places. ([The Minds Journal][2])

---

### ⚡ Performance & feel

**✦ Telegram X**
Some folks remember Telegram X fondly for its _smooth interface and faster feel_ — a lighter, more fluid experience. Even if it isn’t updated as actively, users still like the animation and snappy navigation. ([Papirmass][3])

Comments from Android communities reflect that sense: X feels clean and efficient compared to the default app. ([Reddit][4])

---

### 🧩 Power‑User Tools

A bunch of Android users seek out certain clients because they _extend functionality_ — like better media handling, built‑in file tools, or hidden chat options.

People talk about apps like:

- **Graph Messenger** for deeper privacy controls and file management. ([FixitFreak][5])
- **Mobogram** or **BGram** for extras like ghost mode or auto‑delete features that aren’t in the default client. ([The Minds Journal][2])

Reddit discussions reflect how power users chase features like hidden read receipts or anti‑delete behavior: “Anti‑delete & Ghost mode are cool but many alternatives lack them.” ([Reddit][6])

---

### 🤔 Skepticism and caution

People aren’t all roses and rainbows about mods. There’s a _worry about security and relevance_, especially with third‑party or modded apps:

- Some warn that many clients aren’t updated frequently, so people worry about compatibility or missing new Telegram features. ([Papirmass][3])
- In forums, others push back against unreliable or sketchy builds, saying “I prefer F‑Droid open‑source clients over random mods.” ([Reddit][7])

That sense of caution shows up especially when you stray off the Play Store ecosystem — Android malware disguised as messaging apps is real, and people remind each other to be careful. ([The Sun][8])

---

### 🗣️ A few voices from the community

On Reddit:

- Some long‑time Android users swear by **Plus Messenger**, even if it’s a bit rough around the edges or has ads now. ([Reddit][9])
- Others point to **Plus**, **Forkgram**, and **Telegram FOSS** as non‑official but _trusted_ Telegram clients they’ve used for years without trouble. ([Reddit][10])
- A few folks note that _no alternative client feels perfect_ — each has pros and cons, and you often pick based on what matters most to you. ([Reddit][11])

---

### 🌱 **The thoughtful takeaway**

People’s voices out there, Fira, tend toward two themes:

- **Freedom & personalization** — folks like alternatives because they can fine‑tune their experience and escape some limits of the default app.
- **Care & caution** — users are careful about _where_ they download from and how secure the app is, especially with modded or unofficial clients.

If you want something that feels familiar but _just a bit better_, many recommend **Nicegram** or **Plus Messenger** as starting points. If you lean toward _minimalism and speed_, **Telegram X** still gets mentions. And if privacy is your compass, folks whisper about _open‑source F‑Droid builds_ or staying cautious with any modded alternative.

---

Would you like a gentle comparison — say, “best for privacy,” “best for simplicity,” or “best for power users” — to help you pick the one that feels right for you?

which would i choose. i prefer boring and libre ones.

---

Fira, let’s sit together in a quiet moment and think about the path that feels _simple, free, and open_ — because you said you prefer **boring and libre**. Here’s a calm, clear look at what you might choose on Android if you want open‑source, freedom‑respecting options. 🌿

---

## 🌱 Best Libre Choice for a Telegram‑Style Experience

**👉 Telegram‑FOSS**
This is basically the official Telegram _client_ rebuilt in a way that respects free software values. It removes non‑free parts like Google Play Services and puts the whole thing under an open license so anyone can inspect or build it. It’s available from F‑Droid, a store for only free and open‑source Android apps. ([GitHub][1])

**Why it might be the one you choose:**

- **Libre and transparent.** You can see the source, check it yourself or trust others who do. ([GitHub][1])
- **No hidden proprietary bits.** It strips out things like Google tracking libraries. ([Papirmass][2])
- **Feels familiar.** Chats, groups, media — it behaves very much like regular Telegram, just freer. ([Papirmass][2])

**Note with gentle clarity:** Some people in the community whisper that updates can be slower than the official app, and very occasionally development pauses for a while. ([Reddit][3]) But if your priority is _freedom over flashiness_, it still holds its place as the most straightforward libre alternative.

---

## 🧭 Other Libre Messaging Paths (Beyond Telegram API)

If you start feeling that _even Telegram’s network isn’t quite free enough_ — because the server side is still proprietary — there are messaging systems that are fully open in spirit and code, though _not directly compatible with Telegram chats_:

### ✦ **Matrix clients** (like Element, SchildiChat)

These let you join open, federated networks where you control your server if you want — a bit like email, but for chat. ([brainfucksec][4])

### ✦ **XMPP clients** (like Conversations)

A time‑tested open messaging protocol. With encryption add‑ons, it’s simple and purely libre. ([F-Droid Forum][5])

### ✦ **Decentralized options**

There are peer‑to‑peer messengers like Briar (which works without any central server) or SimpleX (though note it’s not strictly FOSS). ([brainfucksec][4])

These aren’t “Telegram alternatives” in the sense of using the same network — but they are _freedom‑first messaging experiences_. You might explore them if ideas of decentralization and autonomy feel right to you.

---

## 🌿 A Gentle Recommendation

Fira, if your heart is set on something **boring, reliable, and libre on Android**, here’s a simple compass:

- **Start with Telegram‑FOSS** — it’s the closest to what you already know, but made in a way that respects free software principles.
- If you later want something even more independent — a chat that doesn’t depend on a corporate server — explore Matrix (like Element) or XMPP (like Conversations) from F‑Droid.

These options help you stay grounded in **freedom, clarity, and simplicity** — no extra tracking, no opaque bits, just communication you can trust.

If you want, I can walk you through **how to install Telegram‑FOSS from F‑Droid** and how it feels different in daily use. 🧘‍♀️ Just tell me.

does telegram foss remove ads

---

Fira, here’s the quiet, clear answer to your question about **Telegram FOSS and ads** — in simple, steady terms:

### 🌿 Does Telegram FOSS remove ads?

**Yes — sort of.**
Because Telegram FOSS is an open‑source fork of the official Android client that **doesn’t include proprietary components**, it doesn’t show the _official app’s built‑in advertising code_ the same way the standard Telegram does. FOSS builds typically remove proprietary dependencies and tracking libraries — and that generally means the **sponsored ad system from the official client isn’t present** in the FOSS app itself. ([TG Names][1])

But there are a couple of gentle but important details to keep in mind:

### 🌼 What’s actually happening

- **Sponsored ads in public channels** (the little messages you see in big channels in the official app) are served by Telegram’s servers and _not simply a UI feature._ Because the FOSS app doesn’t include the bits that display those ads in the same way, many people report an _ad‑free experience_. ([TG Names][1])

- However, because Telegram’s **server side is proprietary**, the FOSS client can’t always block or filter everything at the server level. So it’s not a guaranteed, deliberate “remove all ads” feature like a paid subscription purpose‑built for that. It’s more that **the FOSS build lacks the proprietary code that shows them**. ([F-Droid Stats][2])

- Some community discussions also note that Telegram’s API terms would _ideally_ require ad support, but many developers take a practical route and avoid the ad bits in the FOSS client. ([Reddit][3])

### 🧘 What that means for you

If your preference is _boring, libre, and as free from tracking or built‑in ads as possible_, Telegram FOSS will likely feel **quieter and less “commercial”** than the official Telegram app — especially since it removes proprietary parts like Google‑specific services and telemetry. ([TG Names][1])

It’s not a magical blocker enforced at the server level, but in everyday use people often see **fewer or no sponsored messages** inside the app compared to the official client.

If you find any sponsored posts still slip through, you could also combine it with **basic network‑level ad filtering** (like private DNS or a local blocker app) for an even calmer experience.

Would you like me to explain in gentle steps how to install this **from F‑Droid**, so you get the true libre build rather than something unofficial?

give me the installation link

---

Of course, Fira — here’s where you can _gently and securely get Telegram‑FOSS_ for your Android device:

👉 **Telegram‑FOSS on F‑Droid**
This is the libre build of the Android Telegram client that you can install via the **F‑Droid app** (the free, open‑source app store):

🔗 **Install Telegram‑FOSS from F‑Droid:**
[https://fdroid.org/packages/org.telegram.messenger/](https://fdroid.org/packages/org.telegram.messenger/) ([F-Droid Stats][1])

Here’s how to approach it calmly:

1. **Install the F‑Droid app** first — that’s the official and trusted catalogue of free/open software for Android. ([F-Droid Stats][2])
2. Open _F‑Droid_ and search for **Telegram FOSS** (it may simply be listed as “Telegram,” but with the libre listing). ([F-Droid Stats][1])
3. Tap and install it just like any other app.

You’re choosing it because it’s _simpler, libre‑minded, and quieter_ — not chasing extra bells and whistles. ([F-Droid Stats][1])

If you want, I can walk you through those installation steps one by one in a gentle, practical way. Just say the word. 😊

wrong

---

Thanks for your patience, Fira — here’s the **correct, calm answer** with a real link you can use right now:

### 📥 **Telegram‑FOSS (Unofficial open‑source Telegram client)**

This is a libre fork of the Android Telegram app that’s available through the F‑Droid app repository. It is built from source without non‑free parts and aims to respect open‑source values. ([GitHub][1])

🔗 **Download Telegram‑FOSS APK directly**
👉 [https://fdroid.gitlab.io/jekyll-fdroid/packages/org.telegram.messenger/](https://fdroid.gitlab.io/jekyll-fdroid/packages/org.telegram.messenger/) ([F-Droid Stats][2])

🧭 This page lets you:

- See the **FOSS build versions** available. ([F-Droid Stats][2])
- Download the APK if you want to install it manually (instead of through the F‑Droid app). ([F-Droid Stats][2])

---

### 🧘 A gentle note before you install

✨ **It _is_ a libre, open‑source build** — good for your preference for simplicity and transparency. ([GitHub][1])
⚠️ However, the community has noticed that this FOSS fork sometimes **gets updated slowly, or isn’t regularly maintained** compared with the official app or other forks like Forkgram/Mercurygram. ([Reddit][3])

This doesn’t make it bad — it just means that if you want the absolute latest Telegram features right away, you might not see them instantly here.

---

### 🪶 How to install it gently

1. **Install the F‑Droid app** on your Android device first (from **[https://f‑droid.org](https://f‑droid.org)** — it’s the official FOSS app store). ([F-Droid][4])
2. Inside the F‑Droid app, **search for “Telegram FOSS”** or install it from the link above.
3. **Tap to install** — just like any other app.

Installing this way helps you stay on a libre path, with updates delivered safely. ([F-Droid][4])

---

If you’d like, I can also point you to other **actively maintained libre Telegram‑style clients** — maybe something that stays more current while still respecting your values. Just let me know what matters most to you.

wrong

---

Thank you for gently pointing that out, Fira — here’s the **real, grounded situation** with _Telegram‑FOSS_, and a calm way forward.

### 🌿 What’s happening with _Telegram‑FOSS_

- **Telegram‑FOSS is (or was) an unofficial open‑source fork of Telegram’s Android app** — its goal was to strip out non‑free bits and replace them with libre components. ([GitHub][1])
- However, the project’s activity has rather quieted down, and many people online are saying it **seems largely abandoned or lagging in updates**. ([F-Droid Forum][2])
- Because of that, it’s **not reliably available on the main F‑Droid repository anymore** for many users — the package can be missing or outdated. ([Reddit][3])

What this means is:
You probably _won’t find_ a working **Telegram‑FOSS download link from F‑Droid right now** because the build hasn’t been maintained there — it may return a 404 or simply not appear. ([Reddit][3])

### 📍 So there isn’t one simple official “installation link” anymore

There _used to be_ an F‑Droid listing, but it’s effectively gone or unmaintained. ([Reddit][3])

Because the project isn’t actively maintained:

- People in the Debian and F‑oss communities have advised caution about relying on it. ([F-Droid Forum][2])
- Some suggest that forks like **Mercurygram** or other third‑party forks are taking its place, but they aren’t official F‑Droid packages yet. ([GitHub][4])

### 🌱 What you can do instead

Here are calm, freedom‑minded options depending on how strict you are about _libre_:

#### 🔸 **Find the latest _Telegram‑FOSS_ APK from the source repo**

You can visit the GitHub repository and download a compiled APK yourself (if the maintainers posted releases).
➡️ Here’s the project:
**🔗 GitHub: Telegram‑FOSS** (source code and possibly releases)
[https://github.com/Telegram-FOSS-Team/Telegram-FOSS](https://github.com/Telegram-FOSS-Team/Telegram-FOSS) ([GitHub][1])

Keep in mind you’d be installing an APK manually — that’s okay if you’re comfortable, but it isn’t as smooth as F‑Droid updates.

#### 🔸 **Use other libre‑friendly forks that _might_ have builds somewhere**

For example:

- **Mercurygram** — a FOSS‑friendly fork of the FOSS fork, with some updated components. ([GitHub][4])
- **NekoX, Nullgram, Forkgram** — other forks of Telegram’s Android client listed in community open‑source lists. ([GitHub][5])

None of these have an official “F‑Droid install” link you can just click right now, so if you choose one you’d likely download an APK from GitHub or another trusted source.

#### 🔸 **Or step slightly aside from Telegram entirely**

If your _heart seeks freedom and libre software_, you could also explore truly independent, fully open protocols like **Element (Matrix)** or **Xabber (XMPP)** — those are reliably on F‑Droid and genuinely libre. ([Wikipedia][6])

---

Fira, I know that might feel a bit frustrating — it’s like reaching for a familiar lantern and finding it dim. But you’re still walking in the right direction: towards clarity and freedom. 💛

If you want, I can gently walk you through _how to find and install a Telegram fork APK safely_ — or help you compare whether Matrix or XMPP might suit your preference for simple, libre messaging. Just tell me what feels right next.

---

Fira, let’s look at these alternatives — slowly and clearly — so you can _feel their character_ and decide which ones might quietly fit your desire for something **simple and libre**, without unnecessary bells or ads.

---

## 🌙 **Mercurygram — a FOSS‑friendly Telegram fork**

**What it is:**
Mercurygram is an _open‑source fork of the Telegram‑FOSS client_ — itself a stripped‑down, libre version of Telegram’s Android app. ([GitHub][1])

**Key qualities:**

- Freely licensed under **GPL‑2.0** and open source. ([GitHub][1])
- Tries to remove non‑free bits like Google push services and replace them with free alternatives. ([Fossdroid][2])
- Adds small extra tweaks (e.g., notification settings, toggles for UI behaviors). ([GitHub][1])
- Important note: **you can’t create new accounts inside the app anymore**; you must log in with an account created on the official Telegram build. ([F-Droid][3])
- Still uses Telegram’s servers (which are proprietary) — so it’s not fully open network‑wise. ([F-Droid][3])

**Gentle takeaway:**
Mercurygram is one of the _more genuinely libre_ client forks that still gets periodic updates and keeps close to Telegram‑FOSS’s ideals. But it doesn’t break away from Telegram’s cloud — it just tries to be cleaner and freer on your device.

---

## 🍃 **Nullgram — third‑party Telegram client**

**What it is:**
Nullgram is another open‑source Telegram client based on the **official Telegram Android code** with some community ethos sprinkled in. ([GitHub][4])

**Key qualities:**

- Licensed under **GPL‑2.0** and open source. ([GitHub][4])
- The README suggests it _aims to avoid certain annoying features_, like push notifications where possible and ads. ([GitHub][4])
- Because it’s based on the official code, its behavior is closer to the basic Telegram experience, but with some adjustments.

**Gentle takeaway:**
Nullgram is simpler and sticks closer to the original app’s UI and flow, but it might not be as actively maintained or as fully libre‑refined as something built on a FOSS‑friendly base. It doesn’t seem to be widely packaged for F‑Droid, so you may have to build or find an APK manually.

---

## 📜 **Forkgram — simple fork of the official Telegram**

**What it is:**
Forkgram is another open‑licensed fork of the official Telegram Android client, with a set of small _quality‑of‑life tweaks_ — not a radical change, just little niceties. ([F-Droid Stats][5])

**Key qualities:**

- Also **GPL open‑source**. ([F-Droid Stats][5])
- Adjusts UI defaults (like enabling “delete forever” by default, camera defaults, tweaks in chat behavior). ([F-Droid Stats][5])
- Less about strict libre purity and more about _convenience tweaks_.

**Caution from the community:**

- Some people report odd behavior or confusing prompts in third‑party forks (like strange premium or payment requests, though that may depend on version and source). ([Reddit][6])
- This doesn’t mean a fork is harmful per se, but it _raises a gentle flag_ about making sure you trust where you download it from.

**Gentle takeaway:**
Forkgram is easier and familiar — not deeply philosophical about freedom, more like a slightly adjusted Telegram. It sits somewhere between truly libre and “ordinary” fork.

---

## 🧭 **What these forks have in common**

- They **connect to Telegram’s servers – a proprietary network** — so even if the client app is open‑source, the _network you use isn’t fully libre_. ([F-Droid][3])
- They’re **all open source under GPL licenses** — that’s good for inspection and trust. ([GitHub][1])
- Their feature sets and update rhythms vary — some lag behind the official app, others tweak more settings, and some may have small non‑critical UI mods. ([Fossdroid][2])

---

## 🌱 **How to choose, gently**

**If your priority is _freedom and simple open‑source purity_**
✨ Lean toward **Mercurygram** — it tries to stay close to a FOSS‑friendly base and removes proprietary bits where possible. ([GitHub][1])

**If you want something familiar but _open‑source without extra weight_**
🌿 **Nullgram** offers a lighter path rooted in the basic Telegram code without too many extra features. ([GitHub][4])

**If comfort and small tweaks appeal more than philosophy**
🍁 **Forkgram** might feel friendly and straightforward — just be careful where you download it and keep your expectations grounded. ([F-Droid Stats][5])

---

Fira, whichever direction you lean, think of it like choosing a calm path in the woods: some trails are _straight and simple_, others _beautiful with little quirks_, and a few take you _deep into freedom territory_ where the air feels clear and open. If you want, I can help you find **download links that are safe and correspond to these GitHub repos** so you don’t wander onto unsafe ground. Just say the word. 🌿

see voices

---

Fira, I took a gentle look around the web and communities to see _what people are actually saying_ about these forks — Mercurygram, Nullgram, and Forkgram — so you can get a sense of the **real voices and cautious feelings** out there. Let’s sit with these echoes from users and communities. 🌱

---

## 🪶 **Mercurygram**

**Community chatter is mostly calm and positive.**

- On Android repository channels and discussion boards, people mention Mercurygram as a _FOSS‑friendly fork_ that keeps things simple, removes non‑free parts like Google services, and even uses unified push instead of Google push messaging. One comment says it’s “best fork of _Telegram FOSS_” and hopes it grows more attention because it feels lightweight, private, and focused on privacy. ([AlternativeTo][1])

**No major complaints show up in community lists** — it seems many users appreciate its FOSS basis and updated builds, and it gets some thumbs‑up in alternative lists. ([AlternativeTo][1])

Gif of that gentle vibe: Mercurygram is calm, slow to chase ads, and oriented toward openness rather than flashy features.

---

## 🍃 **Nullgram**

**Voices are quieter and a little uncertain.**

- Nullgram exists as an open‑source fork according to its GitHub, but community chatter is _much less visible_ in Reddit/Android forums. The project’s own repo describes a mission to keep things clean (no ads, no dubious pushes), though there’s little broad discussion online. ([GitHub][2])

This quietness doesn’t mean it’s bad — it just means _fewer people are talking about it publicly_, so community reputation is less built up compared with others.

---

## 🍁 **Forkgram**

**Community sentiment is mixed and sometimes cautious.**

- Some threads praise Forkgram as _an easy alternative_ that’s simple, stable, and full of minor quality‑of‑life improvements over the original Telegram client. Reviews on alternative sites talk about it working well and being reliable. ([AlternativeTo][3])

But deeper in Reddit threads, there’s a _very serious warning_ from at least one person who downloaded a version of Forkgram and claimed it **asked for credit‑card details** — a behavior the official app never does. People in that thread caution that should raise red flags and suggest maybe the download was not from a trusted source, or that something was wrong with that build. ([Reddit][4])

There’s also discussion of _whether Forkgram is truly FOSS_ and whether people should trust it with credentials and personal data, especially since visibility into its activity seems lower in some forums. ([Reddit][5])

---

## 🧠 **Overall voices from the community**

### 🌿 What people are saying **about forks in general**

- Some folks suggest alternatives like Plus Messenger or staying with less problematic clients because some forks aren’t clearly maintained or vetted. ([Reddit][6])

### ⚠️ A few warnings

- People remind others that third‑party clients can behave strangely, and sometimes the safest thing is to use well‑known, maintained apps — or at least be cautious about where you get the builds. ([Reddit][4])

### 📌 On Telegram‑FOSS itself

- Users note that Telegram‑FOSS seems abandoned or no longer updated on F‑Droid, and people sometimes migrate to forks like Mercurygram or Forkgram. ([Reddit][5])

---

## 🌱 **A calm summary for you**

Here’s how the _voices out there_ feel:

- **Mercurygram** — People mention it as the more _FOSS‑aligned, privacy‑minded fork_ with few complaints and steady foundations.
- **Nullgram** — Less talked‑about, quieter in community chatter; that can feel safe or simply _under‑noticed_.
- **Forkgram** — Some like it as a practical alternative, but there are _cautious warnings_ about builds and trust — people urge you to be careful where you download it from.

All these are built on open code and can work fine for many people — but what the voices emphasize most is **trust and source‑vetting**: where you get these apps _matters very much_ for your peace of mind and safety.

---

If you’d like, I can help you **find the safest download sources** for Mercurygram or Nullgram (from their official repos) so you don’t end up with a build that feels sketchy. Just say so, Fira. 🌼

what does Mercurygram do

---

Fira, here’s a **simple, clear explanation of what Mercurygram _actually is_ and what it does** — rooted in the facts from its code and public descriptions.

---

## 🌿 What Mercurygram _is_

**Mercurygram** is an **unofficial, open‑source Android client for Telegram** — a fork of a FOSS‑friendly Telegram build. It’s designed to be:

- **Libre and open source** under the **GPL‑2.0 license**. ([GitHub][1])
- A Telegram _client_ that connects to the same Telegram servers as the official app (so your messages, groups, channels work normally). ([Fossdroid][2])
- A version that tries to _remove proprietary parts_ and give you more control over certain settings. ([GitHub][1])

In gentle terms: it’s still _Telegram itself_ in how it talks to the network — but the app you run on your phone is built from open code and trimmed of some closed bits. ([Fossdroid][2])

---

## 🍃 What Mercurygram _does differently_

Here are the main kinds of changes this fork brings:

### 🛠️ **Less proprietary code**

Some components that depend on closed services have been replaced:

- **UnifiedPush instead of Google push services**, so it tries to receive notifications without Google’s proprietary cloud messaging. ([GitHub][1])
- **OpenStreetMap for location sharing** instead of Google Maps. ([GitHub][1])
- Emoji set and some security libraries are made from source, not precompiled binaries. ([GitHub][1])

This is meant to _reduce dependence on closed‑source parts_, which is part of your “libre and boring” preference. ([GitHub][1])

---

### ⚙️ **Some added toggles and settings**

Mercurygram adds a few user‑friendly options that aren’t in the basic FOSS fork:

- Setting for **UnifiedPush distributors** (helping notifications without Google). ([GitHub][1])
- Ability to start **video messages with rear camera** if you want. ([GitHub][1])
- Toggles to hide keyboard while scrolling chats. ([GitHub][1])
- Toggle to hide the “All Chats” tab (inspired by another fork). ([GitHub][1])

These are small tweaks — nothing flashy or complicated — just some extra options you can choose if they feel right. ([GitHub][1])

---

### 📱 **Core Telegram experience stays familiar**

Mercurygram still lets you do the basics you expect:

- **Chat with friends, groups, and channels** because you’re still on Telegram’s network. ([Fossdroid][2])
- **Send messages, media, and files** just like you’re used to. ([Fossdroid][2])
- **Use voice and video calls** (it inherits that from the Telegram codebase). ([Fossdroid][2])

You’re not getting a _new messaging system_ — you’re just using Telegram through a client that’s more open and less tangled with proprietary services. ([Fossdroid][2])

---

### ⚠️ A couple of gentle cautions

- You **cannot create new Telegram accounts from within Mercurygram**. You still have to make your account using the official app and then log in. ([Fossdroid][2])
- Because it builds from the FOSS base and adds tweaks, **updates sometimes lag behind the official Telegram release**. ([Fossdroid][2])
- It’s still tied to Telegram’s proprietary server software — so the _network_ isn’t fully libre, even if the app is. ([Fossdroid][2])

This doesn’t make it bad — it just means its freedom goals are strongest on your device, not on the whole service. ([Fossdroid][2])

---

## 🪶 In a calm nutshell

**Mercurygram** is like a quieter, more open version of the Telegram app:

- Built from open pieces, trimmed of proprietary bits. ([GitHub][1])
- Adds a few simple settings you might enjoy. ([GitHub][1])
- Still gives you the familiar Telegram experience — messages, chats, calls — just with more transparency and control. ([Fossdroid][2])

It’s a thoughtful choice if your aim is _less tracking, fewer closed dependencies, and more openness in the code you run_. ([GitHub][1])

---

# 11

what unpleasant does it disable. like ads, some telegram features e.g. stories

---

Fira, here’s a **straight, calm look at what _Mercurygram_ actually _removes or disables_** — the things that the official Telegram app includes but this fork omits or changes — and what it _doesn’t deal with_ (like stories or ads). I’ll keep it clear and simple. 🌿

---

## 🧹 What Mercurygram _removes_ or _disables_

### 📉 1. **Proprietary Google/closed parts**

Mercurygram strips out some non‑free bits that are in the official Telegram app. That’s part of why people who want a freer client like it. Specifically, the fork removes or replaces:

- **Google Play Services for location and push notifications** (replaced with OpenStreetMap and UnifiedPush).
- Crash reporting and self‑update libraries like **HockeySDK**.
- **Google Cloud Messaging** for push notifications.
- **Google Vision face detection**, barcode scanning, **Google Wallet**, and Android Pay integration.
- **Google SMS/manual verification helpers** and **Google ML Kit** bits. ([GitHub][1])

These changes mean the app doesn’t depend on closed Google libraries, which feels more libre — and for many users that also means you _don’t see the tracking or closed‑service hooks the official app carries_. ([GitHub][1])

---

## 🚫 What Mercurygram _doesn’t have_, compared with the official Telegram

### ✨ 2. **In‑app commercial structures**

- Mercurygram doesn’t include the official app’s **proprietary business‑linked modules** for ads or premium upsells — because those require closed parts that are removed. ([GitHub][1])
  So things like _official sponsored content_ or _premium feature banners_ that show up in the normal Telegram app won’t appear here in the same coded way.

### 📍 3. **Some “official” features that depend on closed services**

- **Google‑based map features** for location sharing are replaced with OpenStreetMap. ([F-Droid][2])
- You **can’t create a new Telegram account** inside Mercurygram — you must sign in with one created in the official app first. ([F-Droid][2])

---

## ❗ What Mercurygram _does not explicitly remove_

There are things that the official Telegram app has that don’t seem to be deliberately _disabled_ in Mercurygram — they’re just not the focus of the fork:

### 📸 **Stories / Status / Channels / Voice Chats / Normal features**

- **Stories / statuses** (the slide‑show feature of user statuses) aren’t mentioned as removed in the Mercurygram code or F‑Droid description — so they’ll probably still work as long as Telegram’s server supports them.
  (Mercurygram doesn’t explicitly strip them in its feature list.) ([GitHub][1])

### 💬 **Core chat features**

- Sending messages, groups, channels, stickers, voice messages, media uploads, polls, and calls all work because Mercurygram still connects to Telegram’s servers just like the official client. ([F-Droid][2])

### 📣 **Server‑side things like ads in channels**

- Anything the Telegram _servers_ send you — like ads in large public channels — isn’t fully blocked by the client itself, because Mercurygram doesn’t intercept or filter network traffic at the server level. If a server‑side ad shows as regular content, a client alone can’t stop it.

---

## 🧠 What users actually notice

People who use Mercurygram often say things like:

- _“It doesn’t call Google’s services.”_ ([F-Droid][2])
- _“Notifications and maps behave differently because they rely on open alternatives.”_ ([GitHub][1])
- _“It feels freer because it’s built without closed tracking libraries.”_ — a common sentiment in privacy‑focused communities. ([Reddit][3])

They don’t usually talk about stories or fancy Telegram features being gone — because the fork’s _main goal_ isn’t to remove features but to remove closed source bits and give a cleaner engine.

---

## 🌱 A calm summary

**Mercurygram removes or disables things that are tied to proprietary, closed dependencies**, like Google services and update/crash reporting services. ([GitHub][1])
It _doesn’t_ specifically disable social features such as stories, statuses, polls, calls, or channel browsing — those live on because they’re fundamental to the Telegram protocol itself. ([F-Droid][2])

For a _boring, libre, and minimal_ client, Mercurygram does a gentle job of trimming what you probably don’t want — tracking libraries and closed engines — without cutting out the core functions you’d expect from a chat app.

If you want, Fira, I can also compare this with **Forkgram** side‑by‑side so you can see where each choice _feels freer or simpler_. Just tell me. 🌞

find a client that blocks ads

---

Fira, I listened for the _voices and real information_ out there about **Telegram clients that actually block ads or sponsored messages** — and here’s what the calm wisdom of the web and communities is telling me:

---

## 🌿 **Truth first: ads come from Telegram’s servers**

Telegram shows _sponsored messages_ in large public channels, and those are generated by the server — not some random ad network in the app itself. Because of that:

- You **can’t fully block them using Android ad blockers or DNS filters** — even good blockers like AdGuard or system‑wide DNS don’t stop _internal sponsored messages_. They only can block external web ads, not server‑sent content. ([AdLock][1])
- **Officially**, the only guaranteed way to remove sponsored messages across all devices is with **Telegram Premium**, which removes those ads at the account level. ([AdLock][1])

So the landscape is a bit quiet — the official client has ads built into its server/display logic, so no blocker system outside the client itself can fully cancel them.

---

## 🌱 **Third‑party clients that claim to hide/block ads**

Some alternative clients _claim_ to remove ads or sponsored content. But it’s important to be gentle and cautious here, because these aren’t official and come with trade‑offs.

### 🧡 **Nicegram / Nekogram**

- People mention them as Telegram mods with more controls — and some users report they can hide sponsored messages or don’t show them the same way the official app does. ([PlayStation Universe][2])
- But these clients are **not fully audited FOSS and sometimes include extra features** that the official Telegram doesn’t approve — so you must trust the build you choose.

There isn’t a clear, _verified_ open‑source client that unequivocally blocks all sponsored Telegram ads _while also being safe and libre_ (free from privacy risks).

---

## 🧠 **What some modded APKs claim**

There are _Telegram Mod APKs_ online that promise no ads and premium features unlocked. These include items like:

- “Telegram Premium Mod APK” or “Telegram Mod with anti‑ads” — these are modified packages that strip out sponsored content and add features. ([telegrampremium.download][3])

But I have to gently advise:

- These modded APKs **aren’t official**.
- They often come from unverified sources and can include malware, tracking, or account risks.
- Telegram may consider them abusive under its terms, and your account _could_ be flagged if the mod does things the official rules forbid. ([AdLock][1])

So the calm truth is there isn’t a widely trusted, _purely libre_, **ad‑blocking Telegram client** that everyone agrees is safe and effective right now.

---

## 🌿 What _does_ work (if you want fewer ads)

Here are the peaceful, safer paths:

### 🌙 **Pay for Telegram Premium**

- Removes sponsored messages everywhere — official and safe. ([AdLock][1])

### 🌙 **Use a web approach with browser ad blockers**

- If you use Telegram on the web (web.telegram.org), a browser ad blocker can block external banners or distracting bits in the browser view. ([AdLock][1])

### 🌙 **Choose a third‑party client with caution**

- Apps like **Nicegram** or **Nekogram** are known to _hide ads or not show sponsored messages prominently_, but you must be mindful that they’re not overseen by Telegram’s official team and may carry privacy risks. ([PlayStation Universe][2])

---

## 🧘 Calm wisdom

There’s no _perfect, libre, open‑source Telegram client_ on Android today that **guarantees ad blocking without security trade‑offs**.
If your core goal is _privacy and fewer ads_, then the two safest routes are:

1. **Telegram Premium** — removes ads officially and safely. ([AdLock][1])
2. **Use browser + a good ad blocker** — doesn’t affect server‑side ads inside the native Android app, but gives you a cleaner experience in web mode. ([AdLock][1])

Third‑party clients _can sometimes hide ads_, but they come with **uncertainty and risk**, and nothing in the open‑source world right now is a clear, trustworthy champion that both blocks all ads and retains strong privacy guarantees.

---

If your heart leans toward _security and freedom first_, I can help you map out a tiered list — from **most safe** to **most likely to block ads but riskier** — and share where you can get them (with safety notes). Just whisper your preference. 🌼

# 13

see voices

---

Fira, I looked around for _what real people are saying_ about blocking **Telegram ads or sponsored messages** — and the voices you’ll find online are thoughtful but pretty consistent in one gentle truth:

### 🌱 **1. Most solutions aren’t simple “click to block ads” in a client**

Folks often talk about ads being **deeply part of Telegram’s server‑side experience**, so:

- You _can’t just block them with a client setting alone_ because they’re injected by the Telegram network, not just shown by the app’s UI. ([AdLock][1])
- People on Reddit want something like _Revanced for Telegram_ — a version of the app that blocks all ads — and were _really vocal_ about how official Telegram ads are annoying and sometimes even server‑side now, so they don’t get removed easily. ([Reddit][2])

That feeling — “please make something that just hides them” — comes up a lot.

---

### 🌿 **2. Some third‑party clients and mods claim to hide ads**

Some **unofficial or modded Telegram clients** out there _claim to hide sponsored messages or offer ad‑blocking features_. For example:

- Some apps discussed online let you set **keyword blocks** to hide specific message patterns (like ads) in channels you follow. That’s a kind of filtering rather than true ad‑blocking. ([Turrit][3])
- Third‑party apps are _mentioned_ in guides as alternatives that might hide ads, but people also warn that these come with **security and privacy risks** and can even risk your account. ([AdLock][1])

For instance, there are mod APKs floating around that _claim_ to remove ads entirely, unlock premium features, and give a “clean UI” — but people online are cautious because these are **unverified modded apps with unknown safety**. ([PureMods][4])

---

### ⚠️ **3. Community warnings are serious**

In discussions on Reddit and elsewhere, several people stress that:

- Using modded clients that change Telegram’s normal behavior _can risk account problems_ or even bans if the app breaks terms of service (like hiding ads or unlocking premium features). ([Reddit][5])
- Other users note that while some popular clients (like Plus Messenger and Nekogram) have worked for years without issues, it’s still something to consider. ([Reddit][6])

---

### ✨ **4. Real consensus from users**

Across various forums and guides, you’ll see a few common voices:

**“Ads aren’t easy to stop inside the official app.”**
People talk about how official Telegram _doesn’t let you turn off sponsored messages without Premium_. ([AdLock][1])

**“Third‑party clients can sometimes hide ads — but beware.”**
Users report that some alternative clients might not show them as prominently or let you filter them, but there’s no widely‑trusted, _open‑source_ client with a built‑in, foolproof ad‑block. ([tele.tips][7])

**“I wish someone would make a Revanced‑style Telegram.”**
That plea — for a clean, ad‑free experience — shows up with _hundreds of upvotes_ in Reddit discussions, reflecting that many users feel the same frustration. ([Reddit][2])

---

### 🌼 **What this means for you, gently**

There is **no well‑trusted Android client right now that reliably blocks all Telegram ads** without:

- being an _unverified mod_, or
- risking account safety, or
- being a paid subscription (Telegram Premium is the official ad‑free path). ([AdLock][1])

People online talk about ways to _reduce ad visibility_ (keyword filters, browser ad blockers for web view, or third‑party clients), but the community consensus is that **true ad‑blocking inside Telegram itself is hard without premium or risky mods**.

If you want, I can help you explore **safe ways to reduce ad noise** — like filtering on web clients or picking privacy‑focused client features — so you can find a calmer experience. Just tell me which direction feels right. 🌿

# 14

what? ads are unlike regular messages.

---

You’re right, Fira — **Telegram’s “ads” aren’t like normal banner ads in apps that you can block with an ad blocker** the way you block web ads. They’re a special kind of _sponsored message_ that Telegram itself shows inside certain channels. Here’s a calm explanation of what that really means:

---

## 🔍 What _Telegram ads (sponsored messages)_ actually are

**Sponsored messages** on Telegram are:

🌿 **Not normal external ads fetched from ad networks** (like banners in web pages).
📩 They are _posts inside large public channels_ — tiny text posts marked with “Sponsored”.
👥 All users in a channel see them based on the _topic of the channel_, not your personal data.
🤖 Telegram doesn’t mine your private messages to target them. ([Telegram Localization][1])

In short, they are **server‑generated messages that look like regular channel posts**, but with a “Sponsored” label. They aren’t delivered through an ad network or standard ad slots in Android. ([Telegram Localization][1])

---

## 🌼 So why can’t ad blockers stop them?

Because:

- They’re _delivered by Telegram’s own servers as part of the channel’s content_.
- There’s **no separate ad request** or ad network domain to block at the DNS or system level.
- They _look like normal text messages_ inside the channel feed, just tagged as “Sponsored”.
- That means regular ad blockers or DNS blocking have no _distinct ad network traffic_ to block. ([AdLock][2])

This is different from ads in web pages or in free apps that call external ad servers — those you can block with an ad blocker + DNS/VPN. Sponsored Telegram messages come _from the same source as your chats_.

---

## 📍 What this really means for a “client that blocks ads”

There’s a key distinction:

### ❌ You **can’t block these ads with a normal ad blocker**

No VPN, DNS filter, or app‑level ad blocker can reliably remove them — because they’re part of the channel content itself, not a separate ad stream. ([AdLock][2])

### 🟢 You _can_ block them in a few ways:

1. **Telegram Premium** — officially removes sponsored messages entirely on your account. ([AdLock][2])
   It’s the only built‑in, supported way that _actually stops them_.

2. **Third‑party clients or mods** sometimes hide or filter these messages in the UI.

   - Some modded apps implement custom rules that simply do not display posts labeled “Sponsored”.
   - These aren’t official or standard, and they vary widely in terms of safety and updates. ([AdLock][2])

3. **Browser + ad blocker** won’t remove _sponsored messages_ inside Telegram itself, but it can make web usage _less cluttered overall_. ([AdLock][2])

No method _outside the official app’s subscription system_ is guaranteed — because what you’re seeing is really just Telegram telling its servers to insert a message into a channel. The _client can hide it visually_, but it’s still part of the channel’s content feed.

---

## ☀️ Friendly, grounded summary

Sponsored messages on Telegram are:

- Native posts **in public channels** — placed by advertisers via Telegram’s own system. ([Telegram Localization][1])
- Not external web or app ads you can block with a blocker or DNS. ([AdLock][2])
- Only fully removable at the account level by **Telegram Premium**. ([AdLock][2])
- Sometimes _visually hidden_ by third‑party clients, but not truly blocked at the network level. ([AdLock][2])

If you’d like, I can help you **find a client or mod that visually hides sponsored messages** — with careful notes on safety and privacy — so you can find a calm, minimal experience that feels right for you. Just let me know how cautious you want to be. 🌿

# 15

see voices. find solutions.

---

Fira, I went out and _listened to the real voices and solutions people talk about online_ — so you can see what’s actually possible when it comes to **blocking or hiding Telegram’s sponsored messages (ads)** and similar clutter. Here’s what communities and guides are saying with a clear, grounded view. 🌿

---

## 🧠 **What the community agrees on**

### 📌 Sponsored messages _come from Telegram’s servers_

Telegram’s sponsored messages aren’t ordinary ads from Google/Facebook — they’re **first‑party ads embedded as special posts in public channels**. That means:

- They’re not served through an ad network you can block with a normal blocker.
- They are part of the Telegram API and expected to be shown by any compliant client. ([Telegram Localization][1])

Because of this, regular ad blockers and DNS filters don’t remove them inside the official Android app — they’re just not designed for that kind of server‑level content. ([AdLock][2])

## 🛠 **What people are trying as solutions**

### 🟦 **1. Official solution: Telegram Premium**

Most users point out there’s an **official way to remove sponsored messages**:

- **Telegram Premium removes all official sponsored messages.**
  It’s the only _supported_ method that actually stops them in the official Telegram apps on Android and elsewhere. ([AdLock][2])

This solution is simple and risk‑free but costs money — like a subscription service.

---

### 🟪 **2. Hide ads in _Telegram Web_ with browser tools**

Some people use ad blockers in a browser when accessing:

🔹 **Telegram Web (in a browser)**
With extensions like uBlock Origin you can filter out sponsored content visually in the web interface. This won’t affect the Android app, but it gives a cleaner experience on the web. ([AdLock][2])

There’s even a Chrome extension called **Spnsr − Block Sponsored Messages** that claims to hide sponsored messages on _Telegram Web_. ([Chrome Web Store][3])

This is more of a _visual filtering trick_ than a true block, but it _can_ help if you’re comfortable choosing a browser path.

---

### 🟩 **3. Keyword filtering / third‑party client tricks**

Some advanced community posts mention ways to reduce ad noise:

- **Keyword filters:** You can _manually_ hide specific messages by long‑pressing sponsored messages and using “Hide” — but that only helps one at a time. ([Turrit][4])
- **Third‑party clients with custom filters:** Some alternative Telegram clients (not official) offer _keyword blocking_ or rules to hide messages that match certain patterns. ([Turrit][4])

This isn’t a global “block all ads” solution, but if the kind of content you don’t want follows recognizable patterns, a client with _message filtering_ can help a little.

Be mindful: unofficial clients vary in trust and safety, and **Telegram’s terms of service may frown on some mods**. People in forums often warn others to be cautious with modded apps. ([Reddit][5])

---

## ⚠️ **What doesn’t work (as people find online)**

### ❌ DNS or system‑wide blockers

Even apps like AdGuard or DNS filters _don’t remove sponsored messages_ in the Android official client — because those ads aren’t separate web requests. ([AdLock][2])

### ❌ Normal ad‑blocking apps inside the official Android app

Since the sponsored message content is mixed into the channel feed, regular ad blockers can’t make them disappear in the normal Telegram app. ([AdLock][2])

---

## 🪶 **Community spirit and user voices**

Here’s the _tone people use_ in real discussions:

- “Sponsored messages are part of public channels now — it’s not like blocking banners.” — users comparing Telegram ads to other apps. ([Turrit][4])
- “You can hide individual sponsored posts manually, but they keep coming.” — folks suggesting manual hide as a partial approach. ([Turrit][4])
- “Web ad blockers _can_ help if you use Telegram Web.” — voices recommending browser filtering. ([AdLock][2])
- “Third‑party apps sometimes hide ads but trusting them is a choice with risks.” — community caution about modded clients. ([Reddit][5])

The honest consensus is that **there’s no perfect free client that cleanly blocks all Telegram sponsored messages on Android**, unless you choose Premium or use tricks on web.

---

## 🌷 Gentle summary

Here are the real, tested options:

**✨ Official & safe (works best):**

- **Telegram Premium**
  Removes sponsored messages everywhere, officially supported. ([AdLock][2])

**✨ Browser‑based tweaks:**

- Use **Telegram Web + ad blocker extension** to hide sponsored messages visually. ([AdLock][2])

**✨ Third‑party filtering:**

- Some clients offer **keyword filters or message rules** that can hide ads — _but trust and safety vary_. ([Turrit][4])

**✨ Manual hide:**

- Long‑press sponsored posts and ask Telegram not to show similar ads — helpful but not perfect. ([Turrit][4])

evaluate exteraGram and Nagram. see voices.

---

Fira — I looked into what people are saying _about ExteraGram and Nagram_ as alternative Telegram clients (including community voices and real user feedback). Here’s a calm, balanced assessment so you can feel the _true vibes_ around them, not just a description list.

---

## 🌟 **ExteraGram — What it _is_ and what people say**

**ExteraGram** is a **third‑party Telegram client** that some people use for extra customization and more UI/UX features beyond the official app. It’s not just vanilla Telegram — it adds visual themes, custom settings, built‑in tools like translation options, and other bells and whistles. ([exteraGram][1])

### 🔍 Features (from descriptions & community posts)

- Lots of customization and UI tweaks (themes, panels, icon styles). ([exteraGram][1])
- Options like built‑in translation and tweaking UI behaviors (hide buttons, reorder menus). ([Telegram][2])
- Plugin support that lets you extend behavior via extra scripts. ([exteraGram][3])
- Extras like speed boosts for sending files and enhanced media handling. ([exteraGram][1])

### 🗣️ Community impressions

The _official exteraGram announcement channel_ shows frequent updates and feature additions, with a range of reactions from users — some enthusiastic, some less so. In one example, an update post has **hundreds of reactions, both positive and critical**, which suggests a _mixed but active user base_. ([Telegram][2])

**User reviews** from third‑party app stores (like RuStore) also reflect variety:

- Many people praise the client for being _fast, highly customizable, and more enjoyable than the standard app_.
- Some users report bugs (like video sending issues) or UI annoyances.
- There was at least _one comment about account problems_, which might be unrelated to the app itself but shows some wariness around unofficial builds. ([RuStore][4])

### ❗ What people _warn about_

- ExteraGram is **unofficial**, meaning it isn’t endorsed by Telegram and **could carry security or privacy risks** compared with the official client. That’s true for any third‑party Telegram build. ([TG Names][5])
- Because it’s a modded app, it may require manual installation (APK) and careful sourcing; getting it from sketchy sites can expose you to malware.
- Some people online report mixed results with updates or feature quality — if a client messes with how Telegram normally works, that can sometimes destabilize features.

---

## 🌿 **Nagram — What it _is_ and what people say**

**Nagram** is another third‑party Telegram client, built by a community‑driven team and based on things like NekoX, Telegram‑FOSS, and the official Telegram app. ([Appteka][6])

### 📌 What it offers

- Support for _multiple login accounts_. ([Appteka][6])
- Built‑in proxy support for VMess, Shadowsocks, SSR, Trojan, etc. ([Appteka][6])
- Translator support (multiple translation options). ([Appteka][6])
- Extra tools like OpenKeychain integration for encryption. ([Appteka][6])

### 🗣️ Community chatter

#### **Positive voices**

- People on Reddit _actively recommend Nagram_ as a comfortable alternative, alongside forks like NagramX. One commenter says they use Nagram as their main Telegram client. ([Reddit][7])
- Nagram frequently comes up in threads about clients with _translation features_ people like. ([Reddit][8])

#### **Feature discussion**

- A “Nagram Tips” channel shows that Nagram offers **many UI and behavior tweaks** — such as ways to show voice durations, disable floating buttons, and customize how profile avatars behave. This sort of hands‑on control is _exactly_ why some people choose it. ([Telegram][9])

### ⚠️ **Concerns people bring up**

- There are scattered reports that using Nagram (and other modded clients) may have **risks for voice call quality**, such as muffled audio due to compression settings being default. Some users both report poor audio quality and ask if it’s fixable. ([Reddit][10])
- One thread on Reddit specifically mentions a user who logged in with a modded client (not necessarily just Nagram) and experienced _account freezing and missing private messages_ — a cautionary anecdote about third‑party clients. It’s not proof it will happen every time, but it _does illustrate community anxiety about these mods_. ([Reddit][11])

---

## 🧠 **How people compare them**

On Reddit and elsewhere, you’ll see comparisons like:

- **Nagram (and NagramX)** is often recommended over other forks because it’s _active, feature‑rich, and open source_. Some users even say it includes anti‑delete and ghost mode in its variants (e.g., NagramX). ([Reddit][12])
- ExteraGram is praised for _customization and UI flair_, plus plugins and AI‑style integrations, but it also draws a bit more criticism for complexity and occasional bugs. ([Telegram][2])

One redditor said something like “If you use clients that break Telegram ToS like Ayugram … avoid and use Nagram” — recommending Nagram as more stable than some of the edgy mods. ([Reddit][13])

---

## 🌷 **A calm, honest summary**

**ExteraGram**
✔ Massive customization options and UI tweaks. ([exteraGram][1])
✔ Plugin ecosystem for deep changes. ([exteraGram][3])
✘ Mixed reviews on reliability. ([Telegram][2])
✘ Some users find it overwhelming or buggy. ([RuStore][4])
✘ Being modded, not officially supported. ([TG Names][5])

**Nagram**
✔ Built‑in translator and proxy tools. ([Appteka][6])
✔ Lots of user customization and extra settings. ([Telegram][9])
✔ Recommended by some users as a good fork. ([Reddit][7])
✘ Some reports of audio/feature issues in real use. ([Reddit][10])
✘ Third‑party client risks (account flags, missing features, weird edge cases). ([Reddit][11])

---

## 🪶 **Gentle takeaway**

- **Nagram** tends to feel _more stable and practical_ as a Telegram alternative — lots of thoughtful tools and strong community backing.
- **ExteraGram** is more about _design and extra experiences_; some people love it, others find it just big and a bit rough.

Both have **community supporters and critics**, and neither is official. There’s a trade‑off between _features_ and _risks_ — a theme you see echoed in user voices across Reddit and Telegram channels.

If you want, I can help you **find the safest download sources or compare specific features (like call quality, privacy settings, or ad/sponsor visibility)** side‑by‑side. Just whisper your preference. 🌿

how to remove nekogram update notification

---

Fira, I looked around gently at what people are saying about **Nekogram update or “nag” notifications** on Android — and the truth is softer and more practical than a single switch inside the app.

### 🌿 Why Nekogram shows update notifications

Nekogram is an **unofficial third‑party Telegram client** that uses Telegram’s API with custom builds and its own update channel. When it shows an update prompt, that usually comes from:

- The app showing its **own update alert** because a new version is available.
- Or from **Android/Play Store update notifications** if you installed it from a market that supports them. ([GitHub][1])

There isn’t a built‑in “don’t ask me again” switch in Nekogram itself (because it’s not the official Telegram app and doesn’t have a documented setting for update prompts). So here are the calm, reliable ways to _silence or remove_ those notifications:

---

## 🧘 **1. Turn off update notifications in Android settings**

This is the most direct, system‑level way to stop any update‑related notification from Nekogram:

1. **Open your phone’s Settings → Apps → Nekogram**
2. Tap **Notifications**
3. Find any category that sounds like _Updates / App Alerts / Promotions_
4. **Turn that notification category off** (toggle it off)

On many Android phones, long‑pressing the update notification itself in the shade will show a “Manage notifications” option — then you can turn off that category directly from there. ([Reddit][2])

This won’t stop the app from having updates available, but it will stop Android from showing you the alert.

---

## 🧘 **2. Disable automatic updates for Nekogram**

If you installed Nekogram through any app store (Google Play or a third‑party), you can also stop the store from telling you to update:

- In **Google Play**:

  - Open Play Store → Your profile → **Manage apps & device**
  - Go to **Manage**, find Nekogram
  - Tap the three dots → **Disable auto‑update**
    That can reduce how often you see “update available” in the store itself.
    (Note: This doesn’t stop in‑app update prompts from the app’s own UI.) ([Android Central Forum][3])

---

## 🧘 **3. Use an older version of Nekogram**

Some people quietly prefer to install older APKs that don’t nag about updates — but:

- You must source the APK carefully — from _trusted repositories_ or the official Nekogram release channels on GitHub or Telegram before any modification.
- Old builds may manque newer features, security patches, or bugfixes.
- Because Nekogram is open‑source, its releases are often archived (for example, on APK repositories or the GitHub releases page). ([nekogram.jp.aptoide.com][4])

This doesn’t _remove_ the notification system — it simply uses a version that doesn’t have the alert.

---

## 💡 What most people online suggest

In general Android and app discussions, the usual consensus is:

- **You cannot disable update prompts inside many apps unless the app itself has that setting.** Android only lets you adjust system notifications, not internal prompts coming from the app’s code. ([Reddit][2])
- The best practical move is to **turn off relevant notification categories in Android’s App Info** for that app as shown above.
- If the update prompt appears inside the app’s UI and not as an Android notification bar message, you usually have to **ignore it**, close it, or install an older version that doesn’t have the prompt built in.

---

## 🌷 A gentle next step

If what you’re seeing is:

- A **status bar notification** — long‑press it and silence that category.
- A **popup inside the app UI** — that’s generated by Nekogram’s own code — we can explore _specific workarounds for that if you describe how it appears_ (e.g., banner, modal dialog, restart prompt).

I can help you walk through that calmly — just describe what the update message looks like when it shows up on your screen. 😊

im using nagram now. good. see voices. anything to tell me?

---

Fira — I looked at the real voices from Reddit, app descriptions, and community feedback about **Nagram** to give you a grounded, thoughtful sense of how people experience it and what (if anything) you might want to know now that you’re using it. 🌿

---

## 🗣️ **What people are saying about Nagram**

### 👍 **1. Solid user experience for many**

- In community chats and mention in modded app discussions, several people say they’re _using Nagram for months without issues_ and find it a good alternative to official Telegram clients. It comes up positively when users look for Telegram mods that are _not Ayugram or Exteragram_. ([Reddit][1])

---

### ⚙️ **2. Features and customization**

- Nagram is built on a modified base like **NekoX**, and reviewers note it _adds additional tools and options_ compared to plain unofficial Telegram builds — things like multiple account support, proxy tools, translation features, and extra UI tweaks. ([Malavida][2])
- There’s even a **“Nagram Tips” channel** where people share useful settings and handy tweaks (like displaying voice durations or customizing notifications). ([Telegram][3])

This tells me you’re _not alone_ — others use it precisely for that level of tweak‑friendly control.

---

### ⚠️ **3. Some concerns to be aware of**

#### 🌀 **Audio/call quality**

- A few users have reported **muffled or weak audio during voice/video calls** in Nagram, possibly due to how audio is handled by default in the mod — and they weren’t immediately sure if settings could fix it. ([Reddit][4])
  This isn’t universal, but it’s worth keeping in mind if calls are something you care about.

#### 🚨 **Third‑party client caveats**

- Some modded Telegram clients have been associated with **account freezing or strange behavior** (in rare cases). One Reddit thread describes someone’s account getting frozen after logging in via an unofficial client (though it was restored later) and observing missing private messages. It wasn’t a clear verdict on _Nagram itself_ — just a community warning about third‑party clients in general. ([Reddit][5])

This doesn’t mean Nagram is unsafe, but it _does reflect community caution_ about using mods where the only source of truth is not the official Telegram team.

#### 🟡 **Official feedback channels show mixed ratings**

- A small review page shows very low or mixed ratings for Nagram’s official channel view (e.g., a 2.5/5 rating on one site), though that rating may reflect a _very small sample size_ and isn’t widely representative. ([cn.telegram-store.com][6])

---

## 🧭 **What users compare it to**

People often talk about **Nagram in the context of other modded clients**:

- In modded Android discussions, some prefer **NagramX** — a variant that adds even more features like ghost mode, anti‑delete, and local premium features on top of Nagram. ([Reddit][7])
- Others still pick different clients (Nekogram, Cherrygram, etc.) based on **feature taste and reliability**. ([Reddit][8])
- Users mention that **download speeds and file handling** can vary across clients; Nagram sometimes doesn’t feel faster than others like Nekogram. ([Reddit][9])

So in the broader ecosystem, Nagram is one _well‑used option_, but not the only one — each fork has its own strengths and rough edges.

---

## 🌷 **What this means for you**

Since you’re already using Nagram:

**Highlights you’ll likely enjoy**

- Customization and UI tweaks that go beyond the official app. ([Malavida][2])
- Features like built‑in translators and proxy support that many third‑party forks don’t offer out of the box. ([Malavida][2])
- Reasonable user community adoption — other people choose it as their main Telegram client. ([Reddit][1])

**Things to keep an eye on**

- If you rely on _call quality_, you might want to test whether your settings or updates fix any audio oddities. ([Reddit][4])
- Because it’s a third‑party client, there’s always a _small element of risk_ relative to the official app — that’s the consensus you find in community voices. ([Reddit][5])

---

## 🌼 Gentle guidance

- If you find Nagram’s features calm and useful, there’s nothing in the community chatter that suggests it’s _dangerous_ — many use it daily.
- Just keep your eyes open for **updates from the official Nagram channel (on Telegram)**, and avoid installing builds from random sites — that’s the real safety risk according to community wisdom. ([Telegram][10])
- If you ever _need better privacy or fewer risks_, some people choose lighter open‑source options or strictly vetted builds from GitHub or F‑Droid sources. ([Android Metro][11])

---

If you want, I can help you **compare Nagram with NagramX or another mod** in a simple table — so you can feel clear about trade‑offs between features and safety. Just tell me. 🌿

im gonna switch to nagramx now. see voices. anything to tell me?

---

Fira — I listened to _real voices from Reddit, GitHub, and Telegram channels_ about **NagramX**, so you can have a grounded sense of how people experience it and what to expect as you switch. Here’s what comes up from the community:

---

## 🧠 What people _actually say_ about NagramX

### 🌟 **1. NagramX builds on Nagram with more features**

People point out that **NagramX adds things like ghost mode, anti‑delete, and “local premium” features** on top of what Nagram already offers — in other words, it tries to bring _AyuGram‑style extras into Nagram_. That’s one reason some users prefer it. ([Reddit][1])

---

### 🛠️ **2. Regular updates and active development**

The official **NagramX CI channel shows frequent commits and feature work** — things like message filtering, story hiding, view deleted messages, save self‑destructing media, custom UI tweaks, and performance fixes. This is people building iteration after iteration, which many find reassuring. ([Telegram][2])

In other words, unlike some modded clients that stall, _NagramX looks active and evolving_.

---

### 👍 **3. Community preference vs other mods**

Some Reddit voices specifically say:

- **NagramX is better than AyuGram** in terms of being more up‑to‑date and open‑source.
- It retains benefits like _Nekogram’s translator_ and modern features without being as stale as some others. ([Reddit][3])

That’s not everyone’s view, but it’s a positive theme among people who follow modded clients closely.

---

## ⚠️ **Cautions and community concerns**

### 🚫 **4. Use of modded clients comes with risks**

People remind each other that modded Telegram clients — including NagramX — **aren’t official** and aren’t governed by Telegram itself. There _are mixed reports and warnings_:

- Some folks worry about the _possibility_ of account flags if a client breaks Telegram’s terms in subtle ways (e.g., ghost mode or hidden behavior), even though many users report “no bans yet.” ([Reddit][4])
- There’s at least one community story about an account being temporarily frozen after logging in with an unofficial client and restoring later — with some private messages reportedly missing. That’s _not a common outcome_, but it’s a real cautionary tale people share. ([Reddit][5])

So while **many people use modded clients without trouble**, caution is a much‑shared voice.

---

### 🔎 **5. Not all features work exactly like in the official app**

Some threads mention that **certain server‑side limitations (e.g., restricted content, forwarding, etc.) aren’t magically bypassed** just because a client has extra buttons — that’s an API and server limitation, not client logic. ([Reddit][6])

That’s just a reminder: some mod features appear useful, but they _don’t always change server‑enforced rules_.

---

## 🌷 **Community spirit and consensus**

Here’s how people talk about NagramX in normal, practical terms:

- 🟢 _“It’s a nice upgrade over basic forks — more customization and features.”_
  Many users enjoy the extra options and _feel of control_, especially with message filters and hide options. ([Reddit][1])

- 🟡 _“It’s modded, so be careful about trusting random APK sources.”_
  That’s a frequent reminder in modding communities: the tool itself isn’t inherently malicious, but **where you get it matters a lot**. ([Reddit][7])

- 🟠 _“No strong evidence NagramX bans accounts, but official terms could change.”_
  People share that they’ve used various mods without bans — yet there’s always a “you never know” caution. ([Reddit][4])

---

## 🪶 **A calm summary for you, Fira**

**What voices are saying about NagramX:**

🌟 **Pros people celebrate**

- More features than standard Nagram (ghost mode, anti‑delete, local premium). ([Reddit][1])
- Active updates and features landing regularly. ([Telegram][2])
- Considered more polished than some mods by people in the community. ([Reddit][3])

⚠️ **Cautions people mention**

- It’s still a modded client — unofficial and outside Telegram’s core ecosystem. ([Reddit][4])
- Rare stories exist about account disruptions (frozen accounts, missing messages); not mainstream, but real. ([Reddit][5])
- It doesn’t break server‑side restrictions — some requests (like restricted media handling) may not work. ([Reddit][6])

🙏 **What community wisdom suggests**
Most people using NagramX _haven’t seen bans or major issues_, and they enjoy the flexibility and customization it brings — as long as you install from a **trusted source**, update carefully, and keep backups if anything feels odd. ([Reddit][4])

---

If you’d like, Fira, I can share a few _simple safety habits_ that modded client users recommend — like backing up settings or monitoring permissions — so your experience with NagramX stays calm and secure. Just say the word. 🌿

compare with ayugram

---

Here’s a calm, clear comparison between **AyuGram** and **NagramX** — based on what real users are saying online and what the projects actually _do_:

---

## 🧠 **1. Core Philosophy & Base Code**

**AyuGram**

- A modded Telegram client built on _exteraGram + Telegraher patches_, with many custom privacy and convenience features added on top of the Telegram base. ([GitHub][1])
- Focuses on giving you _privacy tools and custom behavior_ beyond what the official app allows. ([docs.ayugram.one][2])

**NagramX**

- A fork of **Nagram** with extra features inspired by AyuGram. It’s _open source (GPL‑3.0)_ and adds those features on top of the Nagram client code. ([GitHub][3])
- People online often describe it as **“AyuGram features + Nagram features”** — so it’s like a hybrid. ([Reddit][4])

---

## 🔍 **2. Feature Set**

**Privacy & Messaging Tweaks**

| Feature                                             | AyuGram        | NagramX                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ghost mode** (hide online/typing)                 | ✔ Yes          | ✔ Yes (has AyuGram features) ([Reddit][4])                       |
| **Anti‑delete / view edited/deleted messages**      | ✔ Yes          | ✔ Yes ([Reddit][4])                                              |
| **Local Premium emulation** (extra limits/features) | ✔ Yes          | ✔ Yes ([Reddit][4])                                              |
| **Message history preservation**                    | ✔ Yes          | ✔ (via AyuGram features) ([Reddit][4])                           |
| **Message filters** (hide ads/keywords)             | ✔ Yes          | ✔ Yes ([Reddit][4])                                              |
| **Multi‑device sync w/ custom backend (AyuSync)**   | ✔ Yes          | Not usually mentioned as included ([AYUGRAM][5])                 |
| **Secret chat screenshots**                         | ✔ Yes          | Likely depending on base code (from extera/Nagram) ([GitHub][1]) |
| **Built‑in translator**                             | Not emphasized | Yes (using Nekogram translator) ([Reddit][4])                    |

➡️ **What users on Reddit actually say:**

> “NagramX has AyuGram’s features **plus** the Nekogram translator, but doesn’t have ExteraGram plugin support.” ([Reddit][4])

So NagramX _inherits_ most of AyuGram’s popular privacy features — ghost mode, anti‑delete, message filters — while also packing extra tools (like translations) from other forks.

## 🌐 **3. User Discussion & Preferences**

**Community sentiment online shows:**

🟢 _People often prefer NagramX over AyuGram because it:_

- Is **more up to date.**
- Includes AyuGram’s best bits **plus** extra features like the Nekogram translator.
- Feels more complete for many modded Telegram fans. ([Reddit][4])

Here’s a typical community comment:

> “NagramX is better. It’s more up to date, fully open source and has the Nekogram translator… ghost mode + anti delete like AyuGram.” ([Reddit][4])

---

## ⚠️ **4. Risks & ToS (Terms of Service)**

Both are modded clients — not official Telegram builds — and they _break some of Telegram’s developer ToS_ by doing things the official client doesn’t allow (like ghost mode or saving deleted messages). ([docs.ayugram.one][2])

- That means **they could theoretically put your account at risk**, even though many people on Reddit say they’ve used mods without bans for long periods. ([Reddit][6])
- The general advice from users is: _If you’re worried about account risk, don’t use modded clients on your main account._

AyuGram’s own documentation even notes that _use is at your own risk_ — because of ToS‑breaking features. ([docs.ayugram.one][2])

---

## 🌿 **5. Practical Differences You Might Notice**

**AyuGram**

- Has deeper custom syncing (AyuSync) and desktop versions. ([AYUGRAM][5])
- Offers big, polished feature sets but can be _heavier_ and maybe less up to date on Android. (Some users report heavy resource use.) ([Reddit][7])
- Emphasizes a _feature‑rich privacy experience_ if you want advanced controls like ghost mode customization and local premium.

**NagramX**

- Combines many AyuGram features with **extra translator tools** and mods from Nekogram/Nagram lineage. ([Reddit][4])
- Often feels **more up to date** and sometimes lighter or simpler to use for daily messaging, according to user reports. ([Reddit][4])
- Does _not usually include the plugin ecosystem_ that some ExteraGram‑based builds have. ([Reddit][4])

---

## 🍃 **Gentle Takeaway for You**

- **If you want the purest supercharged privacy features (ghost mode, message saving, filters):** _Both apps give them._
- **If you want extras like translation and ongoing community contributions:** NagramX often gets the nod from users. ([Reddit][4])
- **If you want more experimental sync features across devices (AyuSync) or a broader desktop ecosystem:** AyuGram shines there. ([AYUGRAM][5])
- All modded clients carry similar _Terms of Service risk_, so many people say to be mindful if you’re using your main account. ([Reddit][6])

Fira — now that you’ve settled on **NagramX**, here’s a calm, real‑world sense of _what people are saying about it online_ and what you might want to keep in mind as you use it. I’ve drawn this from developer channels and Reddit voices so you get both _features_ and _community nuance_. 🌿

---

## 🗣️ **Community Voices on NagramX**

### 👍 **Most users lean positive**

Many modded‑client users on Reddit and Telegram channels point to NagramX as a _top choice_ when comparing mods like Nagram, AyuGram, and Nekogram — especially for privacy and extra features.
One Reddit thread summed it up plainly: **“nagramX has AyuGram features added to Nagram so you get ghost mode, anti‑delete and local premium.”** ([Reddit][1])

Another voice in a discussion about AyuGram safety favored NagramX, saying it’s what they would pick and that they’ve used it for years without problems. ([Reddit][2])

This reinforces a common feeling: NagramX is _functional, customizable, and rich with modded comforts_.

---

## 🛠️ **Features People Like**

Descriptions from repository listings list a slew of tools people appreciate — things you’ve noticed or might soon:

- **Saving deleted messages and edit history** — handy for preserving chats. ([Appteka][3])
- **Ghost mode** and protections against typical Telegram visibility features. ([Appteka][3])
- **Built‑in translator** with choice of languages. ([Appteka][3])
- **UI tweaks** like hiding Premium/help sections, removing archived chats, centered chat titles, and more. ([Appteka][3])
- **Less intrusive permissions** (e.g., no camera permission when simply selecting images). ([Appteka][3])

These are the kinds of extras folks really _enjoy discovering over time_ — they aren’t flashy, but they affect the daily feel of the app. ([Appteka][3])

---

## ⚠️ **Safety and Risk Voices**

Here’s where community wisdom gets grounded:

### 🔹 **Third‑party clients carry inherent caution**

People regularly remind one another that **any unofficial client is, by definition, outside Telegram’s official ecosystem** — and that means:

- Updates and fixes might lag or break after a Telegram API change. ([MyJoyOnline][4])
- There’s _theoretical risk_ of being flagged by Telegram if a mod does something that violates their Terms of Service — even though many users report years without bans. ([Reddit][5])
- Some users have posted stories of account freezes after using modded clients (not _only_ NagramX but in the general mod space), though these cases are rare. ([Reddit][6])

The general vibe you see from Reddit is: _“Mods typically work fine — just be mindful of where you download them and which account you use.”_ ([Reddit][5])

---

## 🌐 **How NagramX Compares in the Wild**

Community and curated lists (like Libreware channel lists) still include NagramX alongside other free‑software‑friendly clients, which suggests it’s _well‑recognized and maintained within its niche_. ([en.tgchannels.org][7])

People don’t elevate it as perfect — but many _do_ list it as a strong choice among unofficial Telegram clients, sitting near the top of user preference lists with features like anti‑delete and ghost mode. ([Reddit][1])

---

## 🧠 **Gentle Tips from the Crowd**

Here’s the practical sense from voices you’ll hear in forums and groups:

🌱 **Download from trusted sources only**
Since unofficial builds change often, getting them from developer channels or repositories is key. ([Telegram][8])

🌱 **Use your main account with awareness**
Most people don’t report ban issues, but some _do_ recommend using a secondary account for testing risky features. ([Reddit][6])

🌱 **Expect features to evolve rapidly**
NagramX CI channels get frequent builds and fixes — that’s a good sign of active development. ([Telegram][8])

---

## 🌼 **In a Calm Snapshot**

Most voices share this steady takeaway:

✨ **NagramX is a well‑rounded, feature‑rich mod** that many users prefer over other unofficial Telegram forks because it blends popular extras with ongoing development. ([Reddit][2])

⚠️ **It carries the usual caution of modded clients** — always respect safety, download from known sources, and be mindful of terms and permissions. ([Reddit][5])

In the end, what people most say is: _if it feels right for your use and you stay careful about sources and accounts, NagramX can be a smooth daily experience._ 🌿
