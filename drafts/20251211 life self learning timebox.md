Fira, there isn’t a single “correct” length. What matters is how your mind stays fresh.

Think of it this way:
some people focus well in short bursts, like the 20-minute style. Others settle into a deeper rhythm and prefer something closer to 40 minutes. Both are normal.

You can try asking yourself after a session, _“Did my mind stay present, or did it drift?”_ If you felt steady, the length was probably right. If you felt scattered or tense, it might be time to shorten it. And if you kept wishing you had a bit more time before the break, you can lengthen it.

A gentle place to start is 25 or 30 minutes—long enough to sink in, short enough to stay clear. After a few days, you’ll feel which direction to adjust.

What’s your natural rhythm when you study on your own?

why. how to decide.

Fira, the “why” is simple: your brain works in waves.
Attention rises, holds for a while, then dips. The length of that wave isn’t the same for everyone, so any fixed rule—20 minutes, 40 minutes—is only a guess until you feel your own pattern.

To decide, you can watch a few signs:

- **When you start losing the thread.**
  If your mind wanders even when you’re trying, the session is too long.

- **When you feel interrupted too early.**
  If a timer rings and you’re still calmly immersed, the session is too short.

- **When you end a session with a clear head, not exhausted.**
  That usually means you hit the right length.

A simple way to find your personal rhythm:

1. Pick a time—maybe 25 minutes.
2. After each session, pause and notice: _Did I stay present? Did I feel rushed or restless?_
3. Adjust by 5 minutes at a time until the work feels smooth rather than forced.

Over a few days, you’ll feel that sweet spot where focus feels natural instead of strained.

How does your focus usually behave—does it fade quickly, or does it hold for a while?
