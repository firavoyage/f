### Federal Plain Language Guidelines (March 2011, Rev. 1 May 2011)

This 118-page guide, created by the Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN)—a group of federal employees—helps government writers create clear communications so readers can easily **find**, **understand**, and **use** information. Originally focused on regulations, it now covers broader writing, including web content. It stresses tailoring to your audience, strong organization, precise writing techniques, web adaptations, and testing.

Revision 1 made minor fixes: consistent formatting (especially Section V), spelling corrections, more concise wording, added references, and a better filename. No major changes.

#### I. Think about Your Audience (Pages 1-4)

Write for **your specific readers**, not everyone. Use familiar words based on their knowledge—don't "dumb down" for PhDs or business owners unless that's your group.

- **Identify audience**: Ask: Who are they? What do they know/need? What questions will they have? Best outcomes for agency/users? Tell them upfront why it matters (e.g., "If you want a grant, here's how.").
- **Separate audiences**: Use distinct sections/subparts to avoid confusion, especially in regulations. Example: EPA's 40 CFR Part 745 splits rules for renovators, sellers/lessors, trainers, and states/tribes.

#### II. Organize (Pages 5-16)

Plan structure around readers' needs: purpose first, key info early, background later. Use 3 levels max.

- **Meet readers' needs**: Chronological for processes (e.g., grant steps); general rules first, then exceptions.
- **Address one person**: Use "you" (singular), not "individuals."
- **Useful headings**: Questions ("How do I apply?"), statements, or topics. Use many.
- **Short sections**: Break up dense text; e.g., split long regs into criteria-focused chunks.

#### III. Write Your Document (Pages 17-88) – Largest Section

Build from words → sentences → paragraphs → design aids.

**a. Words (18-48)**
| Category | Key Advice | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Verbs** | Active voice; simplest tense; no hidden verbs (noun-ify); "must" for requirements; contractions OK. | Passive: "Lake polluted by company." → Active: "Company polluted lake."<br>"Shall file" → "You must file." |
| **Nouns/Pronouns** | Avoid verb-to-noun; use "you/we"; limit abbreviations (2-3 max). | "Safety protection procedures" → "Protect worker safety." |
| **Other** | Short/simple words; cut extras; define rarely (alphabetical, end); consistent terms; no jargon/slashes. | "Commence" → "Start"; "and/or" → "either X or Y or both." |

**b. Sentences (49-61)**

- Short (one idea); keep subject-verb-object together.
- No double negatives; main idea first (before exceptions).
- Careful placement (modifiers near words).

**c. Paragraphs (62-68)**

- Topic sentence first; transitions (this/however); short (3-8 sentences); one topic only.

**d. Other Aids (69-88)**

- Examples/lists/tables for complexity; illustrations; emphasis (bold sparingly); few cross-references; reader-friendly design (white space).

#### IV. Write for the Web (Pages 89-99)

Users scan (79% do, per Nielsen); focus on top tasks.

- Identify users/tasks; inverted pyramid (key first).
- Chunk content; conversational tone; repurpose print; limit PDFs; plain techniques + good links (explicit, e.g., "Read annual reports"). Avoid formal fluff ("value added").

#### V. Test (Pages 100-118)

Test early/often: paraphrase (rephrase check), usability (observe tasks), comparative (A/B).

- **Paraphrase**: 6-9 users; fix misunderstandings. VBA example: Clarified "service-connected."
- **Usability**: 3 users; think-aloud. NCI example: Retitled brochure for broader appeal.
- Iterate: Test → Revise → Retest.

## Mastering Clear Communication: The Federal Plain Language Guidelines

In an era where government communication often feels like deciphering ancient hieroglyphs, the Federal Plain Language Guidelines stand as a beacon of simplicity and effectiveness. Originally crafted in the mid-1990s by the Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN)—a group of federal employees committed to making government messages accessible—these guidelines have evolved to help agencies craft documents and web content that citizens can actually use. The core goal? Ensure people can find what they need, understand it, and act on it without frustration. Whether you're drafting regulations, letters, or websites, these principles can transform dense bureaucracy into straightforward guidance. Let's dive into the key strategies, drawing from the guidelines' five main pillars: audience focus, organization, writing fundamentals, web-specific tips, and testing.

### Start with Your Audience in Mind

One of the biggest myths in plain language is that you must "dumb down" your content for everyone. Not true. The real key is tailoring your writing to your specific audience. Assume nothing—know who they are, what they already understand, and what they need to learn.

Imagine you're explaining a research grant process. Don't assume your readers are experts; instead, put yourself in their shoes. Ask: Who are they? What do they know? What questions will they have? This empathy ensures your message lands. For instance, if your audience includes PhD candidates, use appropriate terminology, but if it's small business owners or immigrants, opt for everyday language.

When dealing with multiple audiences, separate them. Mixing instructions for different groups confuses everyone. The Environmental Protection Agency's lead-based paint regulations exemplify this: they divide content into subparts for firms, sellers, training programs, and states/tribes, making compliance clearer for each.

### Organize for Maximum Impact

Good organization isn't an afterthought—it's the foundation. Begin with your document's purpose and key takeaway. Eliminate fluff, and structure content to meet readers' needs.

Chronological order works wonders for processes, like applying for grants: start with eligibility, move to application steps, then evaluation. Place general information first, followed by specifics or exceptions. Limit hierarchy to three levels to avoid overwhelming readers.

Address individuals directly—"you" instead of "applicants"—to make responsibilities crystal clear. Use plenty of informative headings: question-style ones like "How Do I Apply?" guide users better than vague topics like "Applications." Keep sections short; aim for one idea per paragraph to create visual breaks and ease navigation.

### Craft Your Document with Precision

Words are your building blocks—choose them wisely to construct clear, concise messages.

#### Verbs: The Engine of Action

Verbs drive your sentences. Use active voice to specify who's doing what: "The company polluted the lake" beats "The lake was polluted by the company." Opt for present tense for immediacy, and uncover hidden verbs by ditching noun forms like "make an application" for "apply." For requirements, "must" is unambiguous and modern—ditch the archaic "shall." Contractions like "don't" make text conversational and natural.

#### Nouns and Pronouns: Clarity Connectors

Avoid turning verbs into nouns (no "utilization" when "use" suffices). Pronouns like "you" and "we" engage readers directly, shortening sentences. Minimize abbreviations; use nicknames like "the committee" instead of acronyms. If abbreviating, define once and limit to a few per document.

#### Tackle Other Word Pitfalls

Short, simple words trump jargon: "river birds" over "riverine avifauna." Omit redundancies—"advance planning" is just "planning." Define terms sparingly, sticking to common meanings. Consistency is key—don't swap "senior citizens" for "the elderly." And skip slashes like "and/or"; they're ambiguous.

#### Sentences: Keep Them Straightforward

Short sentences (one idea each) enhance readability. Place subject, verb, and object close together. Avoid double negatives—"not unreasonable" means "reasonable." Lead with the main idea, not exceptions. Careful word placement prevents confusion: "We will pay you if you have a disability" is clearer than muddled alternatives.

#### Paragraphs: Bite-Sized Ideas

Start with a topic sentence to set context. Transition smoothly with words like "however" or "therefore." Limit to one topic per paragraph, keeping them under 150 words for skimmability.

#### Enhance with Visual Aids

Examples clarify concepts—use them liberally. Lists break up text, highlighting steps or items. Tables simplify "if-then" scenarios, like deposit requirements for bids. Illustrations, like maps in FAA regulations, convey more than words alone. Bold or italics emphasize key points (but sparingly). Design for readability: ragged right margins, ample white space, and no more than five sections per page.

### Tailor Content for the Web

Web users aren't readers—they're scanners, absorbing just 18% of a page's content. They seek quick answers to tasks, so repurpose print material ruthlessly, cutting by half.

Understand web behavior: Users scan in an F-pattern, focusing on top-left content, headings, and first words. They decide in seconds if your site helps. Write for users' top tasks—identify them via queries, metrics, or direct feedback.

Craft web content with inverted pyramids: key info first, details later. Chunk into sections with headings. Omit fluff; use active voice, pronouns, lists, and tables. Avoid jargon, long paragraphs, and PDFs (use gateway pages if needed). Links should be descriptive—"Annual Reports" matching the destination page, not "click here."

### Test for Real-World Success

Don't assume your document works—test it. Iteration (test, revise, re-test) ensures clarity.

Paraphrase testing suits short pieces: Ask users to explain sections in their words, revealing misunderstandings. Usability testing for longer docs: Watch users navigate and interpret. Controlled studies quantify success, like response rates.

Success stories abound. VBA's paraphrase tests fixed vague check-replacement letters, eliminating calls. NCI's usability tests refined a skin cancer brochure's title, broadening its appeal.

By embracing these guidelines, government communication becomes a tool for empowerment, not exasperation. Clear writing saves time, money, and frustration—ultimately building trust between agencies and the public. For more resources, visit plainlanguage.gov.
