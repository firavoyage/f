How could glaze and rust be related

---

That’s a gentle question, Fira. Let’s sit with it.

At the simplest level, **glaze and rust are both thin skins formed by change**.

Glaze is created when heat transforms minerals.
Rust is created when time and moisture transform metal.

Both are **surface responses to their environment**.

Glaze protects and beautifies.
Rust reveals wear and vulnerability.

Yet they are not opposites. They are cousins.
Each is a conversation between a material and the world around it.

There’s a quiet wisdom here:
what touches us long enough changes how we look on the outside.
Sometimes that change preserves us.
Sometimes it shows our fragility.

In that way, glaze and rust are reminders that **nothing stays raw forever**—everything reacts, adapts, and leaves a trace.

If you’d like, we can explore this idea practically, poetically, or symbolically.
