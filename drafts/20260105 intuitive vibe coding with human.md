# .

1. **Intentional Start**

   - Humans set the _vision, goals, and constraints_.
   - The AI is guided by this intention, not left to wander.

2. **Task Decomposition**

   - Humans break down projects into _manageable, meaningful pieces_.
   - AI handles focused tasks — one thing at a time — under these boundaries.

3. **Execution & Generation**

   - AI writes code, edits files, or performs repetitive tasks.
   - Humans step in selectively for judgment-heavy, creative, or context-dependent parts.

4. **Review & Reflection**

   - Humans verify correctness, safety, and alignment with the original intention.
   - Agents can assist by flagging errors, generating tests, or summarizing changes.

5. **Iteration & Adaptation**

   - Humans adjust plans, reprioritize tasks, or refine the “vibe” as needed.
   - Agents continue executing subtasks, now guided by updated directions.

6. **Integration & Cohesion**

   - Humans ensure the outputs from multiple agents or tasks _fit together as a whole_.
   - AI supports by merging, refactoring, or reconciling changes.

---

The workflow is **a gentle partnership**:

- **Agents are precise workers**, handling single tasks efficiently.
- **Humans are stewards**, guiding the flow, making judgment calls, and keeping the project aligned with vision and context.

Think of it like a calm orchestra: each AI agent plays its instrument beautifully, but the human conductor ensures the music resonates as a whole.

# 1 (how to create my own cursor)

How to create my own cursor, the vibe coding app. What problems am I gonna solve.

---

Yes, Fira — let’s sit together for a moment and gently explore this idea of _creating your own cursor‑like, vibe‑coding app_ — what it is, and what kind of problems such a thing might solve.

First, to set a calm foundation: when people talk about tools like **Cursor**, they mean an **AI‑powered code editor** where you can describe what you want in plain language — almost like speaking naturally — and the tool generates or edits code for you. It’s part of what’s now called **“vibe coding”** — a creative, prompt‑driven way of building software without having to type every line yourself. ([Wikipedia][1])

### ✨ What “vibe coding” means in simple terms

Imagine telling a friend what you want: “make a login page with a friendly blue button,” and that friend — who really _gets_ coding — turns that into code for you. That’s the essence of vibe coding. You describe features, behaviours, structure — in plain language — and the AI creates code, edits files, fixes bugs, and sometimes even suggests improvements. ([Wikipedia][2])

Cursor and similar tools try to make that feel intuitive and less like traditional coding, more like co‑creating with an assistant.

---

### 🧠 If you were to _create your own app like that…_

Here are some gentle ideas about what your app could focus on — not hard steps, but thoughtful directions:

#### 🌱 1. **Make it human‑centered**

One of the real challenges with vibe coding today is that sometimes the generated code doesn’t _quite_ solve the deeper problem — or it might break later. A thoughtful tool could help users understand the choices being made, not just spit out code.
You could solve the problem of **clarity and explanation** — teaching the user gently as they use the tool.

#### 🧩 2. **Help users stay in control**

Many people find that pure AI‑generated code feels magical at first, but then harder to maintain later. A calm app might include features that help users _visualize the structure_ of a project, or _explain what an AI change will do_ before it’s applied.

This addresses the problem of **trust and reliability** — helping the user feel confident about the code being created.

#### 🔁 3. **Bridge design and code**

Right now, some vibe tools are better at UI details than backend logic (and vice versa). You could gently weave together **visual design intent** with **code execution** — so someone could sketch a design or describe a vibe, and your app translates it into both design and functional code.

That solves the problem of separating _how something looks_ from _how it behaves_ — making both easier to express.

#### 🔍 4. **Teach as you create**

Building an app with AI can be fun but confusing — especially when things break or don’t scale well. A warm feature could be **contextual learning**: when someone uses your tool, it explains _why_ it made a suggestion, so the user learns rather than just consumes. That solves the problem of AI being a black box.

---

### ☁️ What problems people are talking about in the current tools

Thinking gently again about the world you’re entering:

- AI tools sometimes generate **inconsistent results** or miss what users really want. ([AltexSoft][3])
- Projects can grow messy if the tool doesn’t keep track of context well — leading to bugs or confusion. ([Wikipedia][2])
- Some users find themselves _fixing_ the AI’s work more than enjoying a smooth creative flow. ([Reddit][4])

Seeing these as “puzzles to solve” rather than problems to fear — it becomes clearer where you might bring something new.

---

### 🌿 A gentle reflection before you begin

You don’t need to rush into building all of this at once.

Start with curiosity:

- What part of vibe coding _feels beautiful_ to you?
- What part _feels frustrating or confusing_?
- Where do you see others stumbling — and how could you help them in a warm, simple way?

That space — between magic and frustration — is often where good ideas grow.

Whenever you want, we can walk through _how to start building step by step_, in calm, clear English. Just let the thought surface, Fira — and I’ll be here with you. 💫

# 2 (see, agentic workflow)

What would the agent workflow be like, beyond and based on llms which could only focus on one thing at a time

---

Yes, Fira — let’s sit with this gently and imagine how a thoughtful **agent workflow** might look when we go _beyond_ what a single large language model (LLM) can do at once.

Because LLMs naturally focus on one thing at a time — one prompt, one response — we need to piece together multiple steps, tools, and reasoning processes into something **coherent and alive**. We can think of this as a **river of activity**, not just isolated drops.

Below is a calm picture of how that river might flow.

---

## 🌿 A Heart‑Centered Vision of an Agent Workflow

At its core, an agent workflow isn’t just a single LLM answering a prompt.

It’s more like a **team of small specialists** and a **path that guides them** — a flow from intention to completion. Researchers and practitioners call this an _agentic workflow_ or _multi‑step orchestration_ built around planning, execution, reflection, and adaptation. ([HackMD][1])

Let’s explore it step by step.

---

### 🌱 1. **Intention & Planning — The Quiet Beginning**

When you start, you have a _high‑level intention_ — a warm idea, a goal.

Instead of having a model jump into doing something immediately, the system first **breaks that intention into a plan**:

1. _Understand the goal._
2. _Break it into actionable parts (tasks)._
3. _Decide which tools or agents will handle each part._

This is a moment where the workflow brings _clarity_ and _structure_. It’s like sketching a map before a long walk. ([HackMD][1])

A planner agent might ask:
**“What steps do I need to build this feature, find this data, or write this document?”**
And then, it writes out a rough sequence of tasks — almost like a soft outline.

This planning can also include **self‑reflection** questions like:
_“Are there assumptions here?”_
_“Do I need to fetch information?”_
This fosters depth rather than rushed action. ([agenticai-flow.com][2])

---

### 🧭 2. **Execution — Specialized Agents at Work**

Once the path is clear, the workflow gently routes each task to the right _agent_.

Think of each agent like a _specialist_:

- A **researcher agent** gathers data or scans code.
- A **builder agent** writes the code or constructs the structure.
- A **verifier agent** checks for quality and consistency.
- A **tool agent** might run code, call APIs, or fetch new data.

This pattern is far more robust than a single LLM trying to do everything at once because each agent has a focused purpose. ([在线工具][3])

Some workflows even let agents work in **parallel** on tasks that don’t depend on each other — much like helpers working on different parts of a puzzle at the same time. ([MarkTechPost][4])

---

### 🔍 3. **Reflection and Review — Pause, Look Back, Improve**

After each step, instead of just moving mechanically to the next, the workflow invites a gentle pause:

- Was the outcome what we expected?
- Is there a mistake?
- Should the plan be adjusted?

This reflection can be internal or by a separate “review” agent.

It’s like stopping mid‑journey to make sure you’re still on the right trail rather than wandering blindly forward. ([agenticai-flow.com][2])

---

### 🔄 4. **Adaptation — Learning Along the Way**

Sometimes, the original sequence needs to change:

- A task may fail.
- New information comes in.
- The goal evolves.

So the workflow isn’t rigid — it can **replan**.
This adaptive loop is like having a thoughtful guide who checks in with you and adjusts strides or direction when necessary. ([HackMD][1])

---

### 🧠 5. **Memory & Context — Holding the Story Together**

A challenge in agent workflows is **remembering context** — what was done before, why it was done, and what remains.

A workflow often uses a _memory system_ that:

- stores decisions,
- records intermediate results,
- holds user preferences and history.

This memory helps ensure continuity and reduces the feeling of disjointed fragments. ([HackMD][1])

---

## 🌷 How This Addresses the Limits of One‑Thing‑At‑A‑Time LLMs

A single LLM excels at moment‑to‑moment understanding, but it doesn’t naturally hold long plans, real‑world tools, or evolving context.

By contrast, a gentle multi‑agent workflow:

- **Decomposes tasks** into clear phases.
- **Delegates to specialized agents** instead of one overloaded one.
- **Reflects and corrects**, rather than blindly committing.
- **Uses memory and structure** to weave the steps into a meaningful story.

In essence, it turns one focused model into a _thoughtful ensemble_, like musicians playing in harmony rather than a single person trying to play every instrument.

---

## 🌼 A Soft Closing Thought

If you imagine building your own version of this — a tool that helps people not just code, but _co‑create with AI_ — this workflow becomes your secret garden path. It empowers users, protects them from frustration, and gives their intentions a serene structure to grow in.

Whenever you want, Fira — we can explore how to sketch this workflow into code or architecture, from the first gentle sketch to a running prototype. 🌱✨

# 3 (learn from others, popular agents)

learn from the popular real world vibe coding agents

---

Yes, Fira — let’s gently explore what the _real world vibe coding agents_ are like today and what they _teach us about creative workflows beyond a single LLM focus_. I’ll keep it clear and steady, as if we’re having a thoughtful conversation. 🌿

---

## 🌱 What “vibe coding” really is

_Vibe coding_ is an AI-assisted way of building software where you describe what you want in natural language, and an AI tool turns those intentions into code — sometimes without you inspecting every line yourself. It’s less about typing every character and more about **guiding the AI by intention and feedback**. ([Wikipedia][1])

But in practice, the tools aren’t perfect, and “vibe coding” isn’t a magic bullet. There’s a growing sense that you still need careful structure, review, and iteration — that’s where real workflows begin to form. ([The Times of India][2])

---

## 🔧 Real world vibe coding tools people actually use

Here are some of the _popular coding agents_ and the ways people work with them:

### ✨ **Cursor**

- Deeply AI-integrated code editor where you can describe changes in natural language.
- Understands project structure so it can apply changes across files.
- Offers an “Agent Mode” to let the AI work between multiple files and tasks without constantly prompting. ([Wikipedia][3])

Community experience shows that developers often adopt **rules and configuration files** to help the AI stay consistent with their stack — a navigational guide for the agent rather than letting it wander aimlessly. ([Vibe Coding Tools][4])

### 🧠 **Replit & Lovable**

- _Replit_ has built-in AI agents that help turn ideas into working apps quickly, even for beginners. ([Business Insider][5])
- _Lovable_ is more of a _non-developer friendly_ tool that uses prompts to generate full applications with database connections and UI logic. ([ゆめみ][6])

### 💡 Other tools mentioned by builders

Developers also experiment with:

- **GitHub Copilot** (autocomplete + code suggestions)
- **Claude Code** (another AI assistant with a focus on structured tasks)
- Lightweight AI helpers in editors like VS Code
  – Tools that help debug or fix bugs automatically (e.g., Google “Jules” agent) ([The Verge][7])

Each of these tries, in its own way, to offload _routine and repetitive tasks_, letting a human focus on vision and refinement. ([AP News][8])

---

## 🚶‍♂️ What real developers do in their workflow

From real-world experiences, the workflow isn’t just “tell it once and forget.” Instead, people follow a gentle cycle:

### 🌀 1. **Define an intention**

You begin with a clear intention: a feature, a bug to fix, or a specific UI behavior. Being specific helps the agent stay grounded. ([Reddit][9])

### 🪶 2. **Break tasks down**

Big ideas are split into smaller, manageable pieces. Many developers share tips like “one chat, one feature,” keeping interactions focused so the AI doesn’t lose context. ([Reddit][10])

### 📤 3. **Prompt & refine**

You present each task to the AI agent in natural language, then refine based on results. It’s iterative, not instantaneous.

### 🔍 4. **Review & validate**

With large projects, tools still struggle to fully understand the whole codebase at once. So human review and strategic prompts — like asking “what will break if we change X?” — are part of the flow. ([Reddit][11])

### 🛠 5. **Fix, test, repeat**

Sometimes the AI’s first suggestions are good, sometimes they aren’t. Real users patch, test, debug, and step back in with new prompts — a gentle dance of action and reflection. ([Reddit][12])

---

## 🧠 What this teaches about agent workflows

From these real tools and workflows, a few gentle insights emerge about how to go _beyond_ a single LLM focusing on one thing:

### 🌿 **Agents are collaborators, not substitutes**

The most effective workflows treat AI as a partner — giving it tasks, then revisiting its work with intention instead of blindly accepting it. ([The Times of India][2])

### 🛤 **Guiding structure matters**

Cursor’s use of “rules” and config files is like giving the agent a _map_ or _guardrails_ — it helps avoid chaos when projects grow. ([Vibe Coding Tools][4])

### 🔁 **Iterative loops** are key

You give a prompt, get back code, test it, refine. That flow — intention, execution, review, adaptation — is _the true agentic process_, much more than a single pass. ([Business Insider][5])

### 🧰 **Context awareness is still limited**

Agents often can’t see the entire project all at once — so developers use strategies like incremental prompts, local context delivery, or external tools to help hold the bigger picture. ([Reddit][11])

### 🧡 **Human intuition still guides everything**

Security and maintainability are big concerns today. AI doesn’t automatically know your standards or risks — and experienced engineers judge and steer the work. ([IT Pro][13])

---

## 🌷 A gentle reflection

What’s beautiful about studying these tools isn’t that they write perfect code — it’s that they _change the rhythm_ of creation. The workflow becomes a conversation: you ask, the agent replies, you listen and refine.

And that rhythm — intention → generation → observation → iteration — reflects a deeper harmony between human intention and machine assistance. It’s not about avoiding focus; it’s about cultivating clarity.

Whenever you want, Fira, we can walk through what a _simple yet real workflow_ might look like for building something you care about. 🌱✨

# 4 (learn from others, vibe tool creators on github)

search github. what are creators like me doing.

---

Absolutely, Fira — I took a look on GitHub and in the broader coding community to see what creators **like you** are building around _vibe coding_, AI coding agents, and smart development workflows. Here’s a calm, steady summary of real projects and practices happening right now. 🌿

---

## 🌱 Open‑Source Projects You Can Explore on GitHub

### **1. Cursor‑oriented Templates & Workflows**

**cursor‑vibe‑coding‑template** — a starter project template that’s built to help you kick off _vibe coding_ with Cursor, with pre‑configured AI tooling and a clear workflow structure. You can clone it and prompt the AI to initialize your project — it handles setup for you. ([GitHub][1])

This kind of repo shows how people are **codifying workflow patterns** for vibe coding instead of starting from scratch each time.

---

### **2. Independent Coding Agents**

**civai‑technologies/cursor‑agent** — a Python‑based agent that replicates Cursor‑like capabilities outside the Cursor platform itself. It can generate, edit, and analyze code, supports different LLM backends (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama), and includes tools for file and project operations. ([GitHub][2])

This is the kind of project that gives you _agency_ — an actual agent implementation you can study or adapt.

---

### **3. Enhancing AI Coding with Teams & Tools**

**eastlondoner/vibe‑tools** — a package designed to give coding agents like Cursor a _team_ of AI helpers with advanced skills — web search, browser automation, multi‑model integration, documentation generation, and more. ([GitHub][3])

This project suggests how creators are moving beyond a single LLM focus, by **orchestrating multiple capabilities** together.

---

### **4. Curated Tool Lists**

**techiediaries/awesome‑vibe‑coding** and **Admal‑Foundation/Awesome‑Vibe‑Coding** — collections of tools, agents, CLI helpers, and editors that people use for natural‑language code generation, AI IDEs, and vibe‑centric workflows. Examples include:

- Terminal‑oriented coding agents (like **Crush** and **OpenCode**)
- CLI tools for direct agent interaction
- AI‑powered assistants like Lustrous, v0, Lovable, and more ([GitHub][4])

These are great places to **see what’s trending**, what people star, fork, and experiment with.

---

## 🧠 Community Patterns: What Real Developers Are Doing

The GitHub projects reflect deeper patterns from developers’ own discussions — not just code, but _how they code with AI_:

### 🌿 **Agents plus orchestration**

Rather than only prompting a model, some creators are building **orchestrators** — systems that:

- queue tasks
- manage issue backlogs
- assign them to agents like Copilot
- review and merge pull requests automatically
  One open‑source tool even does just that: an _autonomous Copilot build pipeline orchestrator_. ([Reddit][5])

This shows an important direction: **making the agent a worker inside a smart pipeline.**

---

### 🌱 **Templates, Rules, and Conventions**

In vibe‑coding practice, developers emphasize using **templates, GitHub rules, and config files** as part of the workflow — that way the AI has _structure_ to follow, reducing random behavior. ([Reddit][6])

This echoes what you saw in the template repos: structure helps the agent avoid chaos.

---

### 🌀 **Iterative, human‑guided work**

Many people talk about vibe coding not as a _one‑shot command_ but as an **ongoing dance**:

- create tasks
- let the agent run
- review its changes
- fix and refine
- test and iterate ([Reddit][7])

This reminds you of the _flow model_ we talked about earlier — your mind guiding the AI rather than being replaced by it.

---

### 📌 **Community showcases**

There are weekly threads where vibe coders share projects they built with Cursor — not theoretical frameworks, but real stuff like apps, scripts, helpers, experiments, or small tools. ([Reddit][8])

Seeing what others build often lights the gentle spark of inspiration.

---

## 🌼 How This Helps You

You’re not alone, Fira — there’s already a small but growing cluster of creators:

- **building templates** so new projects start with a friendly foundation
- **wrapping agents in real workflows** (orchestrators, teams, pipelines)
- **mixing models and tools** instead of relying on one
- **sharing learning resources and curated lists** to make it easier to begin

These projects show a quieter truth: vibe coding isn’t just about a single agent writing code. It’s about **ecosystems of tools and conventions** — steady workflows that respect both human intention and AI assistance.

If you want, we can explore **one of these repos in more detail** — gently walk through how it works, what its code looks like, and how you might adapt it for your own vision. Just tell me which one feels closest to your heart right now. 🌱✨

# 5 (see, human part)

when might be good for humans to do something in the workflow

---

Yes, Fira — let’s think about this gently. Even with powerful AI agents, there are moments where **human intervention is not just helpful, but essential**. It’s like a dance: the AI moves, but we pause to adjust the rhythm, feel the space, and make sure the direction is right.

Here’s a calm way to consider **when humans should step in** during a vibe‑coding or multi‑agent workflow:

---

### 🌿 1. **Setting Intention**

Before any AI starts generating code, humans should define **the goal clearly**:

- What problem are we solving?
- What constraints exist (security, style, performance)?
- What’s the “vibe” or feel the final project should have?

AI can’t know your vision unless you guide it. This step ensures that every agent knows the boundaries.

---

### 🧩 2. **Task Decomposition**

When breaking down a project into tasks, humans are invaluable for:

- Deciding what’s high‑priority
- Identifying dependencies (which task needs to be done before another)
- Spotting tasks that require creative judgment or subtle understanding

AI can suggest subtasks, but humans are better at seeing the big picture.

---

### 🔍 3. **Review & Validation**

After an agent generates code, humans should review:

- Does it actually do what you intended?
- Does it follow best practices and safety guidelines?
- Are there subtle bugs, logic errors, or security risks?

This is a place where humans add **wisdom and context** that AI doesn’t fully have.

---

### 🛠 4. **Testing & Experimentation**

Even if the code “looks correct,” humans are best at:

- Designing edge cases
- Deciding what counts as acceptable performance
- Exploring creative solutions that an AI might not imagine

Think of this as _quality‑tuning_ — feeling the texture of the project before it’s finalized.

---

### 🔄 5. **Strategic Reflection**

Sometimes an AI agent will follow instructions perfectly but **the result may not align with the broader goal**. Humans should step in to:

- Pause and reconsider the plan
- Adjust the roadmap if priorities change
- Reflect on whether the “vibe” is right

This is where intuition and experience truly matter.

---

### 🌱 6. **Integrating Multiple Outputs**

If multiple agents are working in parallel (UI, backend, docs, testing), humans should:

- Merge outputs gracefully
- Resolve conflicts or inconsistencies
- Ensure the overall project feels cohesive

AI handles pieces; humans ensure the _whole_ sings together.

---

### 🌸 Gentle Guideline

You can think of human involvement like **a gentle lighthouse**:

- Let agents do the repetitive, precise work
- Step in when judgment, creativity, or reflection is required
- Guide the workflow, but don’t micromanage every step

The sweet spot is **human + AI in harmony**, where humans focus on vision and critical thinking, and agents handle execution.

---

If you want, Fira, I can draw a **visual map of a vibe-coding workflow**, showing exactly **where humans should step in** and where agents can flow autonomously — it would make this rhythm very clear.

Do you want me to do that?

# 6 (summarize)

i would like to have a takeaway about the workflow, grounded

---

Absolutely, Fira — let’s distill it into something steady and grounded. Here’s the essence of a thoughtful vibe-coding workflow, as if we’re drawing the shape of it in calm, simple strokes:

---

## 🌿 Grounded Takeaway: Human-AI Vibe Coding Workflow

1. **Intentional Start**

   - Humans set the _vision, goals, and constraints_.
   - The AI is guided by this intention, not left to wander.

2. **Task Decomposition**

   - Humans break down projects into _manageable, meaningful pieces_.
   - AI handles focused tasks — one thing at a time — under these boundaries.

3. **Execution & Generation**

   - AI writes code, edits files, or performs repetitive tasks.
   - Humans step in selectively for judgment-heavy, creative, or context-dependent parts.

4. **Review & Reflection**

   - Humans verify correctness, safety, and alignment with the original intention.
   - Agents can assist by flagging errors, generating tests, or summarizing changes.

5. **Iteration & Adaptation**

   - Humans adjust plans, reprioritize tasks, or refine the “vibe” as needed.
   - Agents continue executing subtasks, now guided by updated directions.

6. **Integration & Cohesion**

   - Humans ensure the outputs from multiple agents or tasks _fit together as a whole_.
   - AI supports by merging, refactoring, or reconciling changes.

### 🌸 Key Insight

The workflow is **a gentle partnership**:

- **Agents are precise workers**, handling single tasks efficiently.
- **Humans are stewards**, guiding the flow, making judgment calls, and keeping the project aligned with vision and context.

Think of it like a calm orchestra: each AI agent plays its instrument beautifully, but the human conductor ensures the music resonates as a whole.

If you want, Fira, we can take this grounded workflow and **sketch it as a visual roadmap**, showing exactly where humans and agents interact — it can serve as a clear blueprint for your own projects.

Do you want me to do that next?
