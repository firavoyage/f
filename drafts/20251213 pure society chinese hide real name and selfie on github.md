why do chinese people rarely put their selfie and real name on github

---

It’s a thoughtful question, Fira.

There isn’t one single reason, but a few quiet currents come together.

Many Chinese developers grow up with a strong sense of separating public life from private life. Online spaces, especially technical ones like GitHub, are seen as places for work, not for personal identity. Showing your face or real name can feel unnecessary, even a little risky.

There is also a long-standing awareness of surveillance and data misuse. Using a real name or selfie can make someone feel exposed in ways they didn’t choose. An English username or an abstract avatar offers a small layer of distance, and that distance feels safer.

Culturally, there’s less emphasis on self-promotion. In some Western spaces, a profile photo signals confidence or personal branding. In China, drawing attention to yourself can feel awkward or even unwise. Letting the code speak is often preferred.

Practical reasons matter too. Many developers use GitHub for global collaboration, but their real professional identity lives on Chinese platforms like Gitee, WeChat, or internal company systems. GitHub becomes a tool, not a personal stage.

And finally, language plays a role. Using an English name avoids confusion and friction when working with international teams. It’s not about hiding who they are, but about moving smoothly in a global space.

So what you’re seeing isn’t shyness or secrecy. It’s a quiet choice for boundaries, safety, and focus — a way of saying, gently, “Judge me by my work, not by my face.”

i mean, chinese people tend to not be real everywhere online, not about separating work and life. there could be something deep.

---

I understand what you’re pointing at, Fira.
Yes — there _is_ something deeper.

For many Chinese people, the internet was never experienced as a free, playful extension of the self. From the beginning, it felt like a space that remembers. Words stay. Screenshots last. Context disappears. So people learn, quietly and early, not to put their true self fully anywhere online.

This creates a habit of distance.

There is also a long cultural memory of living carefully within systems larger than oneself. When history teaches you that tides change, that today’s normal can become tomorrow’s mistake, you learn not to leave too clear a trail. Being “not fully real” is not deception — it’s adaptability. A way to remain unharmed as the ground shifts.

Another layer is social harmony. In Chinese culture, the self is not meant to stand alone and exposed. Identity is relational and situational. Who you are depends on where you are, who you’re with, and what role you’re playing. The internet collapses all contexts into one flat space, and that feels unnatural. So people offer a partial self — enough to function, not enough to be pinned down.

There’s also a quiet distrust of being seen without control. Visibility is power, but it’s also vulnerability. When visibility is not fully chosen, people respond by becoming fog instead of stone.

What may look like “not being real” is often a refined survival skill:
be present, but not traceable;
be useful, but not exposed;
be expressive, but not fixed.

In places where the self is encouraged to be loud and consistent everywhere, authenticity means showing more.
In places where the self has learned caution, authenticity means knowing _when_ not to show.

Both come from wisdom — just shaped by very different histories.

where does the fear come from

---

It comes from memory that lives deeper than any single person, Fira.

Part of it comes from history that taught, again and again, that safety can disappear quickly. Campaigns, political shifts, sudden re-definitions of what is “right” or “wrong” — these didn’t just affect leaders, they reached ordinary families. Stories were passed down quietly: someone said the wrong thing, knew the wrong person, stood out at the wrong time. The lesson absorbed was simple and heavy — visibility can turn into danger without warning.

Another part comes from how power has been experienced. When authority feels distant and unchallengeable, people don’t learn to express themselves openly; they learn to read the room. Silence, ambiguity, and flexibility become intelligence, not weakness. Fear, over time, turns into instinct.

There’s also fear born from collectivism. When the group matters more than the individual, standing out doesn’t feel brave — it feels irresponsible. If your words bring trouble, they don’t just fall on you; they ripple outward. So restraint becomes a form of care.

And then there is the modern layer: technology that records everything, paired with rules that are not always clear. When boundaries are invisible and enforcement is uneven, people respond by shrinking their footprint. Not because they are afraid all the time, but because they’ve learned that caution costs less than regret.

What’s important is this: the fear isn’t panic. It’s quiet. Mature. Almost invisible. It doesn’t scream “danger.” It whispers, “Be careful. You don’t need to be fully seen to live well.”

So when you notice people being elusive online, you’re seeing the echo of generations learning how to endure. Not brokenness — adaptation. Not dishonesty — self-preservation.

And once you see it that way, it feels less like fear…
and more like a long, patient vigilance.

what history

---

I’ll answer this gently, Fira, because it’s heavy history, and it lives more in people’s nervous systems than in textbooks.

Several waves matter.

One is the long imperial tradition. For centuries, power was absolute and personal. Speaking carelessly, writing the wrong thing, or being associated with the wrong faction could cost not just a career, but a family’s future. People learned early that words were not light things. They carried consequences.

Then the 20th century compressed trauma very fast.

The Anti-Rightist Movement in the 1950s taught intellectuals that a sentence, a poem, or even silence interpreted wrongly could brand you an enemy. Many were punished simply for speaking honestly when invited to do so.

The Cultural Revolution went deeper. Identity itself became dangerous. Your background, your relatives, old diaries, photographs, even past friendships could suddenly be used against you. Children learned to hide their thoughts. Adults learned to erase traces of who they were yesterday. Trust broke down at the most intimate level.

After that came reform and opening, which brought relief — but not forgetting. The lesson remained: stability can return, but rules can still change. What was unsafe before might become safe, and then unsafe again.

This is why the fear isn’t loud. It’s not panic or paranoia. It’s inherited patterning. Even people born decades later grow up surrounded by indirect signals:
“Don’t say too much.”
“Don’t stand out.”
“Don’t leave evidence.”

When the internet arrived — permanent, searchable, context-free — it collided with this memory. A space that never forgets is unsettling to a culture that learned survival through forgetting, blurring, and adapting.

So when someone avoids a real name, avoids a face, avoids fixing their identity online, they’re not reacting to today alone. They’re responding to a history where being clearly defined was sometimes the most dangerous thing you could be.

That history doesn’t shout anymore.
But it still breathes.
