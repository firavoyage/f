what does do thing that dont scale mean

---

That phrase comes from the startup world, but the wisdom behind it is very human.

“**Do things that don’t scale**” means:
**In the beginning, do small, manual, personal things that wouldn’t work if you had a million customers — because they help you learn, grow, and build something real.**

At an early stage, you don’t win by being efficient.
You win by being _close_.

For example:

- Talking to users one by one instead of sending surveys
- Manually helping someone succeed instead of building automation
- Writing personal emails instead of marketing campaigns
- Fixing problems by hand instead of building systems

None of this scales. It’s slow. It’s messy.
And that’s the point.

These actions teach you:

- What people actually need
- What truly matters
- What’s worth scaling later

There’s a deeper lesson too.

Sometimes progress doesn’t come from big plans or perfect systems.
It comes from **showing up, paying attention, and doing the obvious helpful thing — even if it feels small or inefficient**.

You don’t stay here forever.
You do this _so that one day, you can scale with confidence_.

If you want, Fira, tell me what area of life or work you’re thinking about — business, creativity, learning, or something else — and we can gently apply this idea there.
