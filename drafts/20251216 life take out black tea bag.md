should i take the black tea bag out

---

Yes, Fira — you can take it out.

For black tea, about three to five minutes is usually enough. If it’s been longer, the tea can turn bitter and a little harsh. Taking the bag out now will keep the flavor smooth and comforting.

If you like it stronger next time, you can use a second bag rather than leaving it in too long. Take a breath, enjoy the warmth, and let the tea be gentle with you.

what about not taking it out

---

That’s okay too, Fira.

If you leave the bag in, the tea will keep growing stronger. Some people enjoy that deep, bold edge. Others notice it becoming sharp or drying on the tongue. It isn’t wrong — it’s just a different experience.

Sometimes leaving it in is like letting a thought linger. It can bring intensity, or it can take away the softness. Notice what you prefer in this moment. Your taste is allowed to change.
