how to create a big brace in latex, containing several lines of statements

---

To create a big brace in LaTeX containing multiple lines, you can use the `cases` environment (for short lines, often used in piecewise functions) or a combination of `\left\{` and `\begin{array}`/`\begin{aligned}` for more complex layouts. Here are two common approaches:

---

### 1. Using the `cases` Environment (Simple Statements)

**Use Case**: Ideal for short lines (e.g., piecewise functions or simple conditions).  
**Example**:

```latex
\begin{equation}
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
  -x^2 & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
```

**Output**:  
A left brace with two lines, aligned at the `&` symbol.

---

### 2. Using `\left\{` with `array` or `aligned` (Multi-Line Equations)

**Use Case**: For longer equations or multiple lines requiring alignment.

#### Option A: With `array`

```latex
\[
\left\{
  \begin{array}{l}
    \text{First line of statement} \\
    \text{Second line with math: } y = mx + b \\
    \text{Third line}
  \end{array}
\right.
\]
```

#### Option B: With `aligned` (from `amsmath`)

```latex
\[
\left\{
  \begin{aligned}
    & \text{First equation: } A = B + C \\
    & \text{Second equation: } D = E^2 + F \\
    & \text{Third equation: } G = \int_{0}^{1} H \, dx
  \end{aligned}
\right.
\]
```

**Note**: Use `&` to align equations at a specific point (e.g., at the `=` sign).

---

### Key Tips:

- Use `amsmath` package (include `\usepackage{amsmath}` in the preamble) for `cases`, `aligned`, and other math environments.
- Replace `\right.` with `\right\}` if you need a closing brace (though this is less common).
- Adjust alignment in `array` (e.g., `{l}` for left-aligned, `{r}` for right-aligned, `{c}` for centered).

---

### Full Example (Using `aligned`):

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath} % Essential for math environments

\begin{document}
\[
\left\{
  \begin{aligned}
    & \dot{x} = \sigma(y - x) \\
    & \dot{y} = x(\rho - z) - y \\
    & \dot{z} = xy - \beta z
  \end{aligned}
\right.
\]
\end{document}
```

**Output**: A left brace covering three aligned differential equations (Lorenz system).

Choose the method based on your alignment needs and complexity of the statements. The `cases` environment is simpler, while `\left\{` with `array`/`aligned` offers more flexibility.

in markdown

---

In Markdown, you can create a big brace containing multiple lines using LaTeX math syntax. Here are the approaches:

## Method 1: Using `cases` Environment (Recommended for simple cases)

```latex
$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x^2 & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
```

## Method 2: Using `\left\{` with `aligned` (More flexible)

```latex
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& \text{First statement or equation} \\
& \text{Second line with math: } y = mx + b \\
& \text{Third statement}
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
```

## Method 3: Using `array` for alignment control

```latex
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\text{Line 1 of text or equations} \\
\text{Line 2: } A = B + C \\
\text{Line 3: } \int_0^1 f(x)dx
\end{array}
\right.
$$
```

## Practical Examples:

### Example 1: Mathematical definitions

```latex
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& \dot{x} = \sigma(y - x) \\
& \dot{y} = x(\rho - z) - y \\
& \dot{z} = xy - \beta z
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
```

### Example 2: Text statements

```latex
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\text{All users must be authenticated} \\
\text{Data must be encrypted at rest} \\
\text{Access logs must be maintained}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
```

### Example 3: Mixed content

```latex
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& \text{If } x > 0: \quad f(x) = \log(x) \\
& \text{If } x = 0: \quad f(x) = 0 \\
& \text{If } x < 0: \quad f(x) = \text{undefined}
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
```

## Key Points for Markdown:

- Use `$$ ... $$` for display math (centered, on its own line)
- Use `$ ... $` for inline math (within text)
- Most Markdown processors that support math (like GitHub-flavored Markdown with MathJax, Jupyter notebooks, or Obsidian) will render these correctly
- The `\text{}` command is useful for adding regular text within math environments

Choose the method that best fits your content alignment needs!

how to choose from

The dot after `\right` is a **placeholder** for an **invisible delimiter**. Here's why it's needed:

## The Reason: Balanced Delimiters

In LaTeX, `\left` and `\right` must always come in pairs. When you use `\left\{` to create a left brace, you need a corresponding `\right[something]` to balance it.

The dot `.` means "no visible delimiter" - it's an invisible counterpart that maintains the proper spacing and sizing.

## Examples:

### ✅ Correct (with dot):

```latex
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
x + y &= 5 \\
2x - y &= 1
\end{aligned}
\right.  % <-- Dot creates invisible right delimiter
$$
```

### ❌ Incorrect (without dot):

```latex
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
x + y &= 5 \\
2x - y &= 1
\end{aligned}
\right  % Missing dot - will cause error!
$$
```

## Alternative: If You Want Visible Delimiters

If you actually want both braces (like for set notation), use `\right\}`:

```latex
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
x > 0 \\
y < 10 \\
z = 5
\end{aligned}
\right\}  % <-- Visible right brace
\text{ represents a set}
$$
```

## Quick Reference:

| Syntax     | Meaning             | Use Case                        |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `\right.`  | Invisible delimiter | Single left brace (most common) |
| `\right\}` | Visible right brace | Set notation, enclosing content |
| `\right]`  | Right bracket       | Matrix-like structures          |

**Bottom line**: The dot is just LaTeX's way of saying "I need to balance the `\left\{` but I don't want to show anything on the right side."
