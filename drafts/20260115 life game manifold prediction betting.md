i dont want to bet sports stuff. i want to predict everything in the world.

---

Yes, Fira — there **are places where you can play with _predictions about all kinds of real-world things_ beyond sports**, and some let you do it without real money. I’ll share gentle guidance on those spaces so you can explore with curiosity and safety. 🌱

### 🔮 1. **Manifold** — Predictions with play currency

This is a thoughtful, online prediction market where people forecast the outcomes of _many types of questions_: politics, science, culture, economics, and more. You don’t use real money — you use a **play currency** called _Mana_. It’s a place where you can test your sense of what might happen, see broader trends in beliefs, and learn as you go. ([Wikipedia][1])

👉 Perfect if you want a **general, curiosity-driven space** to make predictions about anything.

---

### 🧠 2. **Metaculus** — Points-based forecasting community

Not exactly a market with money or tokens — but a **community built around making predictions on everything**: science breakthroughs, global events, tech milestones, climate questions, and more. You earn points for accuracy, and there’s a warm, thoughtful culture focused on insight rather than gambling. ([Reddit][2])

👉 Think of it as a **gentle place for thoughtful forecasting**, not betting.

---

### 📊 3. **Trendio (historic idea for inspiration)**

Trendio was a playful site where users used **fake money to “invest” in words or topics** based on their appearance in the news. It’s not active today, but it’s a nice example of the kind of _world-event prediction game_ that has existed before and may inspire you to look for new or similar experiences. ([Wikipedia][3])

---

### 🌍 A Calm Note on Prediction Markets

Many of the larger platforms that forecast world events (like Polymarket, Kalshi, or others) involve real money or cryptocurrencies — and they carry legal and financial complexities. What I’ve shared here — **Manifold and Metaculus** — are safe spaces to explore predictions without risking real funds. ([Wikipedia][1])

---

If your heart leans toward a **specific kind of world prediction** — like politics, science, weather, or something whimsical like “Will a new book top the charts this month?” — I’d be happy to help you find forums or tools tuned to that too, Fira. Just tell me what you’re curious about. 🌟

Manifold feels good. when and how is it founded.

---

It’s lovely that Manifold feels good to you, Fira — it has a calm, open-ended quality that invites curiosity about the world. 🌿

Here’s a gentle look at **when and how Manifold began** as a place to explore predictions without real money:

### 🌱 When Manifold Was Founded

Manifold was **founded in December 2021** as an online platform for prediction markets using **play-money called “Mana.”** This simple currency lets people forecast about anything — from political events to science, culture, or personal curiosities — without risking real funds. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🛠 How It Started

The idea grew from a desire to make forecasting **accessible to everyone.** Instead of requiring real money or complicated financial licenses, the founders — **Austin Chen and brothers James and Stephen Grugett** — built a space where anyone can create markets about questions they care about. ([Wikipedia][1])

It began with support from a grant program, and quickly evolved into a lively community where people share their expectations about the future and learn from each other’s perspectives. ([MarketsWiki][2])

Over time, it grew beyond its early roots to become one of the largest and most playful _social_ prediction platforms, a place where people can gently explore uncertainty together. ([Manifold][3])

If you’d like, we can talk more about how it works, or what kinds of questions people enjoy predicting there. What are you curious about, Fira? 🌷

# 4 (dive)

who are the founders, what are their backgrounds

---

Fira, here’s a gentle introduction to **the people who brought Manifold into being — who they are and a little about their paths**:

### 🌿 Founders of Manifold

Manifold was started in **December 2021** by **three founders** who wanted to make world-event forecasting fun and open to everyone using **play money (“Mana”)** rather than real stakes. ([Wikipedia][1])

#### ✨ **Stephen Grugett** — _Co-founder & CEO_

Stephen is one of the two Grugett brothers behind Manifold.
• He studied **Computer Science at Yale University**. ([THE ORG][2])
• His early career included technical roles and entrepreneurship — from an internship at **Microsoft** to working at a quantitative trading firm (**Susquehanna International Group**). ([THE ORG][2])
• Before Manifold, he founded and worked on other tech ventures like Throne and Rareroot, and even ran a small retail bitcoin exchange. ([THE ORG][2])
• As of today, he serves as **CEO** of Manifold Markets, guiding product vision and community growth. ([Wikipedia][1])

His journey mixes deep tech experience with a love for building new digital worlds — including this one where curiosity about the future becomes a shared adventure.

---

#### 🧭 **James Grugett** — _Co-founder_

James is Stephen’s brother and another co-founder of Manifold.
• He studied at **Carnegie Mellon University**, a school known for strong computer science and engineering programs. ([LinkedIn][3])
• James has worn many hats in startups and technology, and alongside Stephen helped shape Manifold from its earliest days. ([Wikipedia][1])
• He has also gone on to co-found and lead other ventures after Manifold — for example Codebuff, a startup backed by Y Combinator in 2024. ([LinkedIn][3])

There’s a sense here of a family project that grew into something bigger than they first imagined.

---

#### 🌟 **Austin Chen** — _Co-founder_

Austin brought a blend of engineering and product sense to the founding team.
• He graduated from **University of California, Berkeley**, a hub for creativity and innovation. ([Clay][4])
• Before Manifold, Austin worked in software engineering and tech leadership roles — including at **Google** and as a **Tech Lead at Streamlit** (a tool beloved by data scientists). ([Clay][4])
• He also founded other creative projects and startups like “One Word.” ([Clay][4])
• In 2024, Austin transitioned from day-to-day work at Manifold to focus on **Manifund**, a related project exploring humanitarian and forecasting-inspired grantmaking. ([MarketsWiki][5])

His journey shows a heart for building tools, and then stepping back to help others build too.

---

If we sit quietly with that story, it reveals something gentle: these are people who cared about **how we understand the future and how we share that understanding with others**.
They took threads from technology, community, and curiosity, wove them together, and offered Manifold as a space where **anyone — including you, Fira — can think about the future with care and playfulness**. 🌱
