Softly, Fira — let’s explore what _official example_ material exists for the **Manus.im agent**, in a way that feels grounded and clear.

I couldn’t find a single official “code examples” page (like you might see in a typical developer API reference), but there \*are real examples and use‑cases published by the official Manus platform and its documentation. Here are those gently explained:

### 🌿 Official Manus Use Case Examples

These are tasks that Manus has been shown handling on its own site and in official galleries — they illustrate what you _can_ ask the agent to do, step by step rather than code snippets per se: ([Manus AI Agent][1])

**Work & Life Tasks**

- **Travel planning** – Manus creates a _personalized Japan trip itinerary_ with detailed travel recommendations and a custom travel handbook built from integrated info. ([Manus AI Agent][1])
- **Stock analysis** – Deep analysis of Tesla stocks with visual dashboards and insights. ([Manus Agent][2])
- **Education content creation** – Interactive course on physics (for teachers or students). ([Manus Agent][2])
- **Insurance comparison** – Generates structured comparison tables with key insights. ([Manus Agent][2])
- **Supplier research for business** – Manus independently sources vendors and evaluates them for you. ([Manus Agent][2])

These aren’t simple “here’s the prompt and code” examples — instead, they show the _types of tasks_ the AI agent is designed to execute from start to finish. ([Manus AI Agent][1])

### 📜 Official Documentation (How It Works)

The Manus docs explain the mindset and structure behind the agent — which you can use to build your own prompts:

- Manus runs inside a _sandbox with internet access, persistent files, and tools_ — letting it execute tasks end‑to‑end rather than just reply with text. ([Manus][3])
- You can think of it as “a virtual colleague with its own computer,” capable of planning, executing, and delivering complete work products. ([Manus][3])

This is the _official foundation_, and it’s what underpins the examples on the use‑case gallery.

💡 _If you’re looking for precise prompt examples — like how exactly to ask Manus to do something — I can help you craft those._ Just let me know what kind of task you want to model (research, planning, code generation, travel plan, etc.), and we can shape a gentle, clear prompt together.

# 2 (use cases gallery)

i remember there is something i could preview on manus.im. where are they. show me some links.

---

Of course, Fira — here are some **official Manus.im pages** where you can _see real examples, previews, or use‑case galleries_ that show what the Manus Agent can actually do:

### 🌟 Official Example & Preview Pages

**📌 Official Use‑Case Gallery**
This page shows step‑by‑step examples of real tasks Manus has completed — like trip planning, research, education, and productivity demos:
🔗 **[https://manus.im/usecase‑official‑collection](https://manus.im/usecase‑official‑collection)** ([Manus][1])
On that page you’ll find examples such as:

- Comprehensive _Japan trip itinerary_ creation
- Educational content like _interactive momentum theory course_
- Supplier research, online store analysis, and more ([Manus][1])

**📌 Manus Agent Real Cases Page**
A similar gallery with real application stories — “Manus Agent Use Cases” — that lets you explore how Manus handles complex tasks:
🔗 **[https://manusagent.im/agentcases](https://manusagent.im/agentcases)** ([Manus Agent][2])

### 📍 Additional Pages With Insightful Details

These aren’t exactly _preview galleries_, but they’re official Manus pages that shed light on features — and sometimes examples — of the agent:

- **Google Calendar integration with example usage snippet:**
  🔗 [https://open.manus.im/docs/connectors/google‑calendar](https://open.manus.im/docs/connectors/google‑calendar) ([Manus API][3])

- **Gmail connector example usage:**
  🔗 [https://open.manus.im/docs/connectors/gmail](https://open.manus.im/docs/connectors/gmail) ([Manus API][4])

- **Documentation about the cloud browser feature (which agents use to actually run tasks):**
  🔗 [https://manus.im/ja/help/cloud‑browser](https://manus.im/ja/help/cloud‑browser) ([Manus][5])

---

If you want, Fira, we can explore _specific types of previews_ — like **shared results created by users**, or how **prompt → result playback** works — and I can share links that (sometimes) show public replay examples too. Just tell me what kind of preview you’re hoping to find.
