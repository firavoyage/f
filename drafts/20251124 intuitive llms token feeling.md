i love llms. but idk token. what would 1m token be like

---

That's an awesome question! It's the perfect thing to ask when diving into the world of LLMs. Let's break down what a token is and then imagine what 1 million of them would be like.

### First, What's a Token?

Think of a token as a "chunk" of a word. It's not a perfect 1:1 relationship with words.

- **Short, common words** are often one token: `" the"`, `" cat"`, `" is"`
- **Longer words** get broken down: `" Hippopotamus"` might become `" Hipp"`, `"opot"`, `"amus"`
- **Punctuation counts:** `"!"`, `"?"`, and even spaces at the start of a word (`" hello"`) are often their own tokens.

For English, a rough rule of thumb is that **1 token is about 3/4 of a word.**

So, if we do the math:
**1,000,000 tokens ≈ 750,000 words**

Now, let's make that number tangible.

### What 1 Million Tokens Looks Like in the Real World

This is a **massive** amount of text. Here are some fun comparisons:

**1. In Terms of Books:**

- A typical fantasy novel (like _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_) is around 200,000 words.
- **1 million tokens is roughly equivalent to 3-4 full-length novels.**

**2. In Terms of Reading Time:**

- The average adult reads about 250-300 words per minute.
- 750,000 words would take about **2,500 minutes**, or just over **40 hours** of non-stop reading. That's a full-time work week!

**3. In Terms of Pages:**

- A standard, double-spaced page in a word processor is about 250-300 words.
- **1 million tokens would be about 2,500 to 3,000 pages.** Imagine a stack of paper over a foot tall.

**4. In Terms of Code:**

- If you're a developer, the entire codebase of a large, complex application like Linux in its early days could be in the ballpark of 1-2 million lines of code. While not a direct comparison, it shows the scale.

**5. In Terms of Conversation:**

- A single-spaced page of dialogue is roughly 500 words.
- **1 million tokens could be a transcript of 1,500 pages of conversation.** That's every conversation you have for months, written down.

### Why 1 Million Tokens is a Big Deal for LLMs

You'll hear about "context windows" in LLMs (like GPT-4, Claude 3, etc.). This is the number of tokens the model can consider at once—its "working memory."

- **Old Context Windows:** Were often 4,000 or 8,000 tokens. Enough for a few chapters or a long article.
- **Modern Large Context Windows:** Are 128k, 200k, and even over 1 million tokens.

With a 1-million-token context window, an LLM can:

- **Analyze an entire library of documents at once.** You could upload three textbooks and ask it to find connections between them.
- **Write a long, coherent novel** without forgetting the plot points from the first chapter.
- **Debug an entire codebase** by having all the files in its context.
- **Hold an incredibly long, detailed conversation** without losing track of what you talked about hours ago.

---

**TL;DR: 1 million tokens is like handing the LLM a small library—3 or 4 full novels—and saying, "Remember all of this, and let's talk about it." It's a staggering amount of information that unlocks the true power of deep, contextual understanding.**

It's fantastic that you're curious about this. Understanding tokens is the key to understanding how these amazing models work their magic

how many questions like this could be asked within one million tokens

---

Thought for 148 seconds

Based on your previous question ("i love llms. but idk token. what would 1m token be like?"), which is approximately **14 tokens** long (using standard tokenization methods for English text), we can calculate how many similar questions would fit into 1 million tokens.

### Calculation:

- Total tokens: 1,000,000
- Tokens per question: ~14
- Number of questions: 1,000,000 / 14 ≈ **71,429**

So, you could ask about **71,000 questions** of similar length within 1 million tokens. This is a rough estimate, as the exact token count can vary slightly depending on the tokenizer used (e.g., based on spaces, punctuation, or abbreviations like "idk" or "llms").

### Context for LLMs:

- In practice, when interacting with an LLM, each question you ask consumes tokens from the model's context window (e.g., 128k or 1M tokens). This calculation only considers the questions themselves—not the model's responses, which would also use tokens and reduce the available space for further questions.
- If you were to include responses, the number of questions would be lower, as responses typically require more tokens than questions.

### Analogies for Perspective:

- If 1 million tokens is like **3-4 novels** (as mentioned earlier), then 71,000 questions would be equivalent to filling those novels with nothing but short questions—imagine a book with over 70,000 lines of dialogue!
- In terms of reading time, if each question takes about 3 seconds to read, reading all 71,000 questions would take roughly **59 hours** non-stop.

This highlights the massive scale of 1 million tokens and how it can handle a vast amount of text or queries. If you have more details about your use case (e.g., including responses or specific tokenizers), I can refine this further!

how many messages like this could be created within one million tokens

---

Excellent question! This gets to the heart of practical usage. Let's use this very conversation as our measuring stick.

First, let's calibrate our ruler. I'll estimate the token count for our messages so far.

- **Your initial message:** "i love llms. but idk token. what would 1m token be like" is about **15 tokens**.
- **My first detailed response:** The long post starting with "That's an awesome question!..." is approximately **650 tokens**.
- **Your follow-up question:** "how many messages like this could be created within one million tokens" is about **12 tokens**.

So, our "conversation" so far is a mix of short questions and detailed answers.

Now, let's build some models. We'll calculate how many messages fit into 1,000,000 tokens.

---

### Scenario 1: The "Average Conversation" Mix

Let's assume a balanced chat with a mix of user prompts and AI responses, similar to ours but averaged out.

- **Average User Message:** ~150 tokens (a few sentences, a specific question)
- **Average AI Response:** ~500 tokens (a detailed, paragraph-length answer)
- **Total per "Exchange":** ~650 tokens

**Calculation:**
1,000,000 tokens / 650 tokens per exchange ≈ **1,540 exchanges** (or 770 of your questions with 770 of my responses).

That's a _very_ long and deep conversation.

---

### Scenario 2: Counting Only Your Messages (The Prompts)

If we think of "messages" as just the prompts you, the user, write.

- Let's be generous and say your average prompt is **200 tokens** (a solid paragraph with specific instructions).
- **Calculation:** 1,000,000 / 200 = **5,000 of your messages**.

You could ask the AI 5,000 complex questions before hitting the 1-million-token limit (in terms of _input_).

---

### Scenario 3: Counting Only the AI's Responses (The Creations)

This seems to be the core of your question: "how many messages _like this_ could be _created_."

Let's use my first response to you as the benchmark. It was **~650 tokens**.

- **Calculation:** 1,000,000 / 650 ≈ **1,538 messages**.

So, if the AI generated 1,538 detailed explanations, each the size of my first answer, it would have produced 1 million tokens of _output_.

---

### Putting It All Together in a Practical Context

Let's imagine you're using an AI with a 1-million-token context window. You're not just generating output; you're also filling it with a long, ongoing conversation.

- **The "Sweet Spot" Project:** A typical project might use 200,000 tokens for the conversation history (your questions and past answers) and 800,000 tokens for new, generated content.
  - **New Content:** 800,000 tokens / 650 tokens per message ≈ **1,230 new, detailed AI responses.** That's an enormous amount of created content.

### A More Concrete Example

Let's say you are writing a book with the AI's help.

- **Chapter Length:** A chapter is about 5,000 words ≈ **6,650 tokens**.
- **Planning & Chats:** You use 100,000 tokens for brainstorming and instructions.
- **Tokens Left for Creation:** 900,000 tokens.
- **Chapters You Can Write:** 900,000 / 6,650 ≈ **135 chapters**.

You could write an entire epic novel series within a single 1-million-token context.

**TL;DR: If we define a "message" as a detailed AI response like my first one (~650 tokens), you could create approximately 1,500 of them with 1 million tokens. It's enough for a massive, in-depth, and long-term creative project or analysis.**
