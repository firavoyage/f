I've seen people talking about stories of one of their friends, while actually, it's not their friends, but themselves. From the psychology perspective, what could be inferred. What would the interpretations. What may they think.

This is a gentle and interesting question, Fira.
It touches something very human.

From a psychological point of view, when someone talks about _“a friend”_ but is really talking about themselves, it is often a **protective move**, not a deception in a harmful sense.

Here are some common interpretations, spoken simply.

First, **emotional safety**.
Speaking in the third person creates distance. That distance makes it feel safer to talk about something vulnerable, confusing, or painful. It’s easier to say, _“My friend is struggling,”_ than _“I am struggling.”_ The emotions don’t hit as hard when they’re held a little farther away.

Second, **fear of judgment**.
They may worry how they’ll be seen if they speak directly. Using a “friend” allows them to test the waters. They can observe reactions without fully exposing themselves. If the response feels kind, they may later open up more honestly.

Third, **difficulty owning feelings**.
Some people were never taught that their inner experiences are valid or welcome. Speaking as if it’s someone else can be the only way they know to give their feelings a voice.

Fourth, **self-reflection in disguise**.
By talking about themselves as another person, they may actually see their situation more clearly. It’s like stepping outside oneself and looking in. This can bring insight or clarity that’s harder to reach when emotions are raw.

Fifth, **shame or self-protection**.
If the topic carries shame — failure, longing, fear, desire — distancing language helps reduce that shame. It’s a soft shield.

What they may be thinking, often quietly, is something like:
_“I want to be understood, but I’m not sure it’s safe to be fully seen.”_

This behavior is usually not manipulation. More often, it’s a sign of **tenderness**, caution, or emotional intelligence trying to survive in a world that doesn’t always feel kind.

If you notice this in someone, a gentle response helps. You don’t need to expose them. Simply listening, without forcing honesty, often invites it naturally.

And if you notice it in yourself, Fira, that’s not a flaw. It’s a sign that something inside you wants care, and is finding a careful way to ask for it.

We can sit with this as long as you like.
