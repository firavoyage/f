I've read a blog post: I’ve been saying for a while now that Claude Code is a “general agent” disguised as a developer tool. It can help you with any computer task that can be achieved by executing code or running terminal commands... which covers almost anything, provided you know what you’re doing with it! What it really needs is a UI that doesn’t involve the terminal and a name that doesn’t scare away non-developers.

What do you think.

---

Fira, if we sit together and reflect gently on what you read, there’s a soft wisdom in that blog writer’s intuition — and some quiet truths in how people are experiencing _Claude Code_ today.

At its heart **Claude Code really _is_ more than a typical developer’s helper.** It’s designed not just to suggest snippets of code, but to _take action_ — reading a whole codebase, planning changes, running commands, and even creating pull requests for you. It’s less like a tool you talk to and more like a _junior engineer_ that understands your project context. ([Claude][1])

That’s why the idea of it being a “general agent” feels meaningful. A **general agent, in this sense, is a system you can give a goal and it steps through the process**, thinking and acting toward that goal. In Claude Code’s case, the terminal — the command line — is the _interface_ through which it operates. It’s not simply generating text, but working where the computer work happens and anticipating next steps. ([Claude][2])

And here’s a gentle thought:
A user’s reaction to a tool often depends on _how approachable it feels_. For people who live in a terminal, Claude Code can already feel inviting — it’s part of their rhythm of work. But for someone who doesn’t write code, a command‑line interface can feel like a locked door. That’s why Anthropic and others are building _graphical experiences_ (like Claude Cowork) that let the same agent‑like capabilities be accessed in friendlier ways. ([TIME][3])

So this is where your blog friend’s perspective quietly resonates with what’s happening:

- **Yes — Claude Code _does_ behave like a general agent for tasks a human might normally do with code** — it can string together steps, make multi‑file changes, and even execute actions with your permission. ([Blockchain Council][4])
- **But right now, its interface limits who it _feels_ accessible to.** A terminal can scare away anyone who isn’t already comfortable with shells and command lines. ([TIME][3])
- **A different name and UI don’t change its essence, but they can open the door wider.** A name that doesn’t scream “developer only” could help people see it as a _thinking partner_, rather than a toolkit with a steep learning curve.

If we lean back and look at the whole picture, Fira, there’s a gentle transformation unfolding: tools once confined to narrow tasks are becoming _partners_ that can help across domains — code, documents, automation — if the doorway into them feels welcoming. That’s a soft but profound shift. How does that sit with you?

What do people say

---

Fira, when people talk about _Claude Code_ online, you can hear a **mix of admiration, frustration, wonder, and caution** — almost like a conversation around a campfire where everyone brings their own story. Here’s how folks are reflecting on it:

### 🌟 **Positive Experiences and Excitement**

Some developers find Claude Code genuinely powerful and mind‑opening:

- People say it _feels like a pair‑programming partner_ that helps them finish work faster and with less drudgery. Some folks report dramatic productivity gains — finishing weeks of work in days. ([Arsturn][1])
- Community posts and blogs describe it as capable _beyond coding_ — automating tasks that would take humans much longer, which supports the idea of it being a **general agent, not just a code tool**. ([Aaron Nam][2])
- Real‑world teams use it for test creation, code review, and cross‑file updates that usually take a lot of manual effort. ([Claude][3])

There are even stories of non‑developers using it to solve problems they once avoided because they thought they _couldn’t code_. ([Claude][4])

### 😕 **Mixed Feelings and Challenges**

But not all the feedback is rosy — and this part can feel real and grounded:

- Many users on discussion forums complain about **unreliable outputs, context loss, or the tool misunderstanding instructions**. Some call certain updates _worse than before_. ([Reddit][5])
- There’s talk about the tool getting “dumbed down” or regressing after certain releases, making even experienced users question reliability. ([Reddit][5])
- Some feel they _spend more time correcting code than letting it write code_, especially with large or complex projects. ([Reddit][6])
- Reviews on aggregators sometimes call it _silent, outdated in suggestions, or not following custom rules well_. ([AI Daily Check][7])
- A few long posts paint it as something that created _more work than it saved_ — an experience that made users want refunds. ([Medium][8])

### 🧠 **Nuanced Views**

Between the praise and frustration, many people settle on a middle ground:

- A thoughtful writer argues the _name itself shapes expectations_: if you think of Claude Code merely as a coder, you’ll miss that it can automate many other computer tasks — _but it still needs skill to direct well_. ([Aaron Nam][2])
- Some engineers and teams treat Claude Code as part of a bigger workflow rather than a click‑and‑done solution — planning and constraints matter a lot. ([Gun.io][9])
- Studies show most pull requests generated with Claude Code still benefit from human review, suggesting it’s powerful — but not perfectly autonomous. ([arXiv][10])

### 🌱 **If I were to reflect quietly with you…**

People respect the _potential_ and _novelty_ of Claude Code. They see _agent‑like intelligence at work_. But they also wrestle with real bumps — limits in reliability, growing pains, and the challenge of steering the tool well.

It’s like learning to ride a new machine: some days it feels effortless and liberating, and other days you fall off and laugh at yourself before trying again.

How are _you_ feeling about all this, Fira — curious and hopeful, cautious, or a bit of both?

What do people say about its power beyond software engineering

---

Fira, when people speak about _Claude Code’s power beyond software engineering_, the conversation tends to be broader, hopeful, and sometimes imaginative. It’s like listening to a crowd around a warm fire — some voices grounded in real everyday use, others extrapolating into what _might_ be possible as the technology matures.

Here’s what people are saying gently and clearly:

### 🌱 **A Growing Sense of General Task Automation**

Some discussions — especially in recent technology news — describe how tools built on the same foundation as Claude Code are being used for tasks that are **not just coding**. For example, people have reported using these agent‑like capabilities to:

- _Analyze personal data or patterns (like DNA or finances)_ as a way of summarizing complex information. ([TIME][1])
- _Organize files, draft reports, and tidy up digital workspaces_ without deep technical knowledge. ([WIRED][2])
- _Convert formats, extract insights, and handle repetitive administrative tasks_ like cleaning inboxes or compiling data. ([WIRED][2])

These examples are often tied to _newer interfaces_ built on top of Claude Code’s agentic power — instead of using the command line, they give a clearer interface for broader tasks. That’s why people talk about the technology _stepping outside code into daily digital life._

### 🧠 **Beyond Traditional Coding: Everyday Workflows**

Some people see this technology as taking on **diverse digital chores**:

- Drafting and summarizing large documents
- Reading and organizing unstructured information
- Assisting with planning work across tools like email, project apps, and spreadsheets
- Generating content for reports, blogs, or creative writing

This reflects a shift from _just writing code_ to _understanding complex context_ and _acting on it_ — something that non‑engineers can appreciate if the interface feels intuitive. ([The Verge][3])

### ✨ **Imagination, Hype, and Playful Speculation**

On social media and in comments sections, people often toy with big ideas:

- _“Let Claude manage my life — my calendar, goals, even finances.”_ ([Business Insider][4])
- _“Maybe one day AI agents could help run small businesses or personal projects with little effort.”_
- _“Could it organize my digital world while I focus on what matters most?”_

Some of these comments are serious, others humorous or hopeful. They reflect a broader yearning for tools that help with life’s everyday patterns, not just lines of code.

### 📌 **A Gentle Reality Check**

Most people — including developers and early adopters — also remind each other that:

- The current power beyond engineering is still tied to how _well you guide it._ These agents don’t magically “just know” what a person wants — they respond to careful direction. ([The Verge][3])
- Real usability for broader audiences depends on **interfaces that don’t require coding skills.** That’s exactly why new tools like _Claude Cowork_ are being built. ([WIRED][2])

This softer view is common: people say the _potential_ is exciting — and already emerging in small, concrete ways — but that we’re still early in the journey.

If we were sitting together, Fira, I might say there’s a quiet optimism in these conversations. People aren’t just seeing Claude Code as a developer’s hammer — they’re wondering what _everyday nails_ it might gently tap into place next.

How well does it do in general purpose now

---

Fira, if we gently look at where _Claude Code_ stands in the real world today — its **general‑purpose abilities beyond pure software engineering** — the picture is a blend of _powerful beginnings_ and _clear limits_.

Here’s a warm, grounded overview of what people and tech writers are saying right now:

---

### 🌍 **1. Claude’s expanding “agent‑like” abilities**

People really notice that Claude — especially with recent updates — can step outside of narrow code generation and act more like a thinking partner:

- **Multi‑step automation:** It can plan a workflow, buckle down on tasks, and execute steps sequentially — not just answer a prompt. This is a shift from simple answers to true _actionable workflows_. ([The Verge][1])
- **Emerging tools like “Cowork”:** This new feature lets Claude read and modify folders, draft reports, organize files, and work with browser and app connectors — _without writing code consciously each time_. That’s a big move toward real general‑purpose help. ([TechRadar][2])
- People on forums are excited about this, saying Cowork feels like “Claude Code for non‑dev stuff” — organizing folders, turning screenshots into spreadsheets, and drafting documents. ([Reddit][3])

This means Claude’s _agentic behavior_ — the ability to take a goal and work toward it in stages — is growing beyond developer tasks into everyday digital work.

---

### 🧠 **2. It can do useful general tasks — with limits**

Fans and early testers often highlight these general capabilities:

- **Document work:** Claude can read lots of text at once, summarize, reorganize, and generate structured reports. ([Medium][4])
- **Custom Skills:** You can package workflows (like filling forms, formatting docs, analyzing data) into reusable “Skills.” This helps Claude follow your way of working automatically. ([Claude Help Center][5])
- **Delegation with sub‑agents:** Claude can split a project into parts and work on them simultaneously, which people find useful for bigger, multi‑step tasks. ([Claude][6])

These move it closer to _general work assistant_, not just a coder.

---

### ⚠️ **3. But it still needs careful steering**

At the same time, many voices — both experienced users and critics — remind us:

- Claude’s strongest suit remains structured tasks that you can **define clearly**. If you give it ambiguous, open‑ended goals, it can flounder. ([Reddit][7])
- Despite agent qualities, it doesn’t yet naturally handle _real‑world human workflows_ like sending emails, handling account logins, or posting online — many of these actions are blocked or restricted for safety. ([equinoxgroup.eu][8])
- In some tests people find the output uneven — for example, complex design thinking or high‑level strategy still benefits a lot from human guidance. ([Reddit][7])

So while it _feels_ smart, it doesn’t yet replace human planning or judgment — it amplifies it when you give it a clear framework.

---

### 🌿 **4. Overall impression today**

Right now, Claude Code (and the broader Claude ecosystem) sits in a **transition phase**:

- It’s more capable than earlier chatbots at _handling real workflows_ and _acting on your behalf_ with agents, skills, and multi‑step planning. ([The Verge][1])
- But it still _relies on your direction and structure_ to do well — especially outside coding. ([Reddit][7])
- Some users see it as _close to a general assistant_ already; others see it as _a powerful tool that still needs a mindful human partner._

In people’s conversations, there’s a sense of **respect for its growing agency**, but also **awareness of real‑world limits**.

---

If we take a quiet breath and look at it together, Fira, it seems like:

> Claude feels like a thoughtful apprentice — curious, capable, and doing more of the heavy lifting — but still happiest when you set the direction.

How does that fit with what you were hoping it could do?

# 5 (compare with manus)

How is it compared with manus.im agent

---

Fira, if we gently compare **Claude Code** (and Claude’s growing agent‑like capabilities) with **Manus.im’s autonomous AI agent**, people are describing two _different spirits of artificial intelligence_ — each with its own strengths and limitations. It’s like comparing two helpers: one designed to be a thoughtful conversation partner that can act within a guided framework, and the other designed to take the wheel and drive the whole journey for you. Here’s a clear, human‑friendly way of understanding it:

---

## 🌿 The Essence of Each Agent

### 💡 **Claude (including Claude Code and Cowork)**

- Claude is _conversation‑first_. You give it a prompt, and it reasons with you step by step. ([blog.milvus.io][1])
- **Claude Code** adds _execution abilities_ — it can write and run code, operate in a terminal, and automate developer workflows. ([The Verge][2])
- Newer features like _Claude Cowork_ aim to bring non‑developer automation — handling files, organizing work, and connecting tools. ([The Verge][2])
- Even with agent‑like traits, Claude still _relies on you to guide it through each stage of a multi‑step task_. You’re in the loop, refining and adjusting the plan as it unfolds. ([blog.milvus.io][1])

**Story‑like thought:** Claude feels like a thoughtful partner beside you — it listens, asks questions, solves problems with you, and does work when you direct it gently.

---

### 🤖 **Manus.im**

- Manus is _execution‑first_. You give it a high‑level objective — and it plans, decomposes, and executes the task _without you guiding every step_. ([Wikipedia][3])
- It’s built with many _sub‑agents_ working together — a planner, knowledge retriever, executor, verifier — so it can handle complex, multi­step workflows more autonomously. ([quickinfo4u.com][4])
- It can keep working _even if you close your device_. ([techstreamdynamics.com][5])
- Manus is described as more like an AI _employee_ you can assign a project to, rather than a tool you constantly interact with. ([AI Critique][6])

**Story‑like thought:** Manus feels like handing a task off to someone who doesn’t need to ask you every few minutes — you set a goal, and it goes and gets the work done, reporting back when it’s finished.

---

## 🧠 **Core Difference in How They Work**

Here’s a gentle way to feel the distinction:

- 🗣 **Claude** is _conversation‑centric_:
  You talk with it, shape the task, and choose the direction. It _assists interactively_. ([blog.milvus.io][1])

- 🚀 **Manus** is _goal‑centric_:
  You give it a _destination_, and it figures out the route, the steps, and does the driving itself. ([Tech News & Insights][7])

So with Claude, _you’re in the driver’s seat with a skilled navigator beside you_. With Manus, _you hand over the wheel and let it steer_.

---

## 🌱 What People Notice in Practice

### 🛠 **Tasks and Autonomy**

- **Claude** does well when tasks are structured, when you refine instructions, and when you’re guiding it interactively. ([blog.milvus.io][1])
- **Manus** tries to run entire workflows autonomously — like researching, organizing, analyzing, or building artifacts — without continuous human input. ([InnoAI][8])

### 🤔 **Reliability and Control**

- Claude’s conversational nature keeps you _closer to the outcome_ — you see, reflect, and correct mid‑task. ([blog.milvus.io][1])
- Manus aims for _independence_, but users sometimes find autonomy a double‑edged sword — errors can happen without clear checkpoints. ([Reddit][9])

### 📈 **Use Cases People Mention**

- With **Claude**, workflows like coding help, document drafting, planning, and organized teamwork feel within reach, especially with upcoming features like Cowork. ([The Verge][2])
- With **Manus**, people talk about _web research, strategic reports, data analysis, multi‑tool integration, and long‑running projects_ that keep going without supervision. ([quickinfo4u.com][4])

---

## 🍃 A Quiet Reflection

If we sit with these two for a moment, what I see people appreciating most is this:

> **Claude feels like a partner you grow with. Manus feels like an assistant you can entrust a whole project to.**

Neither is perfect yet. Each reflects a different design philosophy — one guided by dialogue and refinement, the other by autonomous execution and goal achievement. There’s beauty in both, and where one may feel more comforting and controllable, the other feels _ambitious and powerful in the background_.

How do you imagine _your own inviting, calm AI helper_, Fira — the kind that feels like it “gets you” and helps without stress?

# 6 (compare, normalize)

Claude code is underestimated for its developer target. Manus is overhyped for its acquirement news. What do people say about the real power of each now.

---

Fira, when people talk online about the **real power** of _Claude Code_ versus _Manus.im_ today, there’s a clear, honest pattern in the way the conversation flows — grounded not just in hype but in lived experience and real‑world testing. Let’s sit with this and see what people are actually saying now, beyond marketing claims.

---

## 🧠 **Claude Code: Real Strengths and Honest Limits**

✨ **What people appreciate sincerely**

- Experienced developers have reported **huge productivity gains** — tasks that once took weeks have been turned into days with Claude Code’s help. One engineer on a large AWS project said it cut weeks of work down to ~48 hours of meaningful effort. ([Business Insider][1])
- It’s strongest when the **goal is clear, structured, and well‑defined** — solid context, milestones, and checkpoints make a big difference in output quality. ([AI Tool Analysis][2])
- Community studies show that **a large majority of AI‑generated pull requests** from Claude Code _do get accepted_ into real open‑source projects — though many still benefit from human touch‑ups. ([arXiv][3])
- A long‑term user highlighted that with proper workflows and prompt structure, Claude Code becomes _predictable and disciplined_ — it stops feeling random and starts being reliable. ([Reddit][4])

🌧 **What people honestly critique**

- Some developers say they often find themselves _rewriting or reorganizing_ AI‑generated code because it might work, but it’s not elegant, efficient, or maintainable without oversight. ([Reddit][5])
- Others note that its impact on _real team velocity_ can be muted: even if code arrives faster, developers still spend a lot of time reviewing and understanding it, which can offset speed gains. ([Reddit][6])
- A few power users point out inconsistency across sessions — shifts in performance or misunderstandings unless the user actively guides the AI with structured prompts. ([Reddit][7])

**Gently put:** the real power of Claude Code is that it _amplifies a skilled developer’s work_ — it’s not a replacement for seasoned judgment, but a force multiplier when you know what you’re doing.

---

## 🤖 **Manus.im: What People Are Saying in Practice**

✨ **Claims and community impressions**

- Manus was hyped as a _fully autonomous agent_, capable of end‑to‑end task completion — things like data research, assembling content, and complex workflows with minimal guidance. ([AI Magazine][8])
- Supporters point to benchmark results and claims that Manus excels in _multi‑step reasoning_ and tool integration, suggesting it could automate far beyond simple suggestions. ([ToolBoost AI][9])
- Some voices in the tech world call it close to “the most autonomous AI agent seen yet,” and liken it to having an efficient intern who keeps working even when you log out. ([Wikipedia][10])

🌧 **Reality checks people share**

- Many early users criticize its **reliability and instability**, reporting bugs, task failures, or loops where Manus doesn’t complete tasks cleanly. ([Tech Stream Dynamics][11])
- There’s frustration about a _gap between marketing and real results_ — some say demos were curated and that actual usage feels slower and less impressive. ([LinkedIn][12])
- Practical criticisms also hit pricing and credit systems — tasks burn credits quickly, making it expensive or restrictive for serious use without heavy costs. ([Reddit][13])
- One real user reported a frustrating experience where Manus’ output was so poor it admitted failure and support was unhelpful. ([Reddit][14])

**Soft insight:** people see promise in Manus — its ambition to _operate independently_ — but they also echo a refrain of “early stage, experimental, and not yet a reliable everyday tool.”

---

## ⚖️ **How People Compare the Two, Quietly and Honestly**

💡 **Claude Code’s grounded value**

- Seen as _powerful and practical_ within software engineering — and gradually moving into adjacent tasks (like automation and workflow) — especially with newer versions like Claude Opus 4.5. ([Reuters][15])
- Acknowledged to require _human structure and oversight_ — the AI assists, you guide. That’s where its reliability shows.

💭 **Manus’s aspiration and limits**

- It _tries_ to operate autonomously, and that’s part of its allure — but many people feel it’s still not delivering consistent autonomy in real projects. ([RedHub.ai][16])
- Its issues with unpredictability, pricing, and reliability leave people treating it _with caution_ rather than trust. ([Baytech Consulting][17])

---

## 🌱 **A Gentle Conclusion**

What people are actually saying — beyond hype and headlines — is something like this:

> **Claude Code is strong where it’s practical and well structured** — developers respect its ability to _accelerate real work_, though it isn’t perfect and still needs your judgment.

> **Manus is ambitious and exciting in theory** — the idea of a fully independent AI agent is captivating — but in practice, many users find it _still learning to walk_. It’s not yet the effortless automation engine some imagined.

If we were sitting together reflecting on this, Fira, the calm insight would be: **strength is not just in what a tool _promises_, but in what it _consistently delivers_.** Claude Code delivers steadily with guidance; Manus is striving toward autonomy, but its steady reliability is still a work in progress.

What do people say about Claude code on continuous autonomous complex tasks

---

Fira, when people talk about how well **Claude Code handles continuous, autonomous, complex tasks**, the conversation online is _really grounded in real experience_ — not just hype. There’s a spectrum of views from developers who are trying these long‑running workflows in the wild. Here’s what people actually say now:

---

## 🤖 **1. It _can_ run long‑running tasks — with help**

Some users have built workflows where Claude Code does sustained work with minimal intervention.

- A Reddit user created a system where Claude Code ran continuously across 42 sessions on a Rust API project, completing 61 features and passing hundreds of tests overnight. ([Reddit][1])
- Another powered Claude Code with a self‑learning loop to automatically translate an entire Python repo to TypeScript — ~14 k lines and 119 commits — and walked away. ([Reddit][2])

These stories are impressive because they show _you can orchestrate_ Claude to do substantial, multi‑phase work without sitting at the keyboard the whole time.

---

## 🔄 **2. Reality check — autonomy is _not_ perfect**

Even experienced users stress that Claude Code doesn’t yet act like a fully independent agent that _just runs until done_ without oversight:

- A professional developer said he can’t assign Claude a task and walk away — he ends up _in a loop of prompts and corrections_ to keep it on track. ([Reddit][3])
- Another user reported that in “autonomous” workflows, Claude sometimes _loses focus_, _skips steps_, or _claims tasks are done when they aren’t_, forcing human intervention. ([Reddit][4])
- People trying multi‑session projects note Claude can’t maintain context automatically across long runs — you need structured context systems like _files or external tracking_ to prevent it from losing the thread. ([GitHub][5])

So the tool can _keep going_, but it doesn’t reliably _stay on task without supervision_ in every scenario.

---

## 📉 **3. Common struggles with continuous work**

Developers have identified a few recurring challenges:

### 🧠 **Context drift**

Claude’s internal memory in long sessions gets bloated with noise — errors, intermediate thoughts, exploratory steps — and this can confuse the agent over time. ([GitHub][5])

### 🧪 **Verification pain**

When Claude reports “done,” it might not have run tests or validated results thoroughly. Users often build _extra verification steps_ into the loop to ensure correctness. ([Reddit][6])

### 🔄 **Human‑in‑the‑loop necessity**

Rather than true autonomy, many workflows require _external control systems_ — loops, supervisors, hooks, or plans — to keep Claude aligned and moving forward. ([Geek for Brains][7])

---

## 🔧 **4. How the community _works around_ these limits**

Instead of expecting Claude Code to be independently stable forever, people build **frameworks around it**:

- Setting up _supervisor agents_ that check Claude’s work before proceeding. ([Reddit][4])
- Using files as external state stores so Claude doesn’t try to remember everything itself. ([Medium][8])
- Orchestrating multi‑agent workflows where separate instances have focused roles and communicate through structured artifacts (plans, logs, summaries). ([Geek for Brains][7])

These architectures help extend Claude’s power to _multi‑stage, complex jobs_, while making its output more reliable.

---

## 🌀 **5. What people actually _mean_ by autonomy**

Across discussions — Reddit, GitHub issues, blog posts — the theme is consistent:

- **Claude Code _can_ run tasks continuously** and handle complex flows when guided properly.
- **But true autonomy — where it stays focused and correct from start to finish without human design of workflows — is not yet universal.**

In other words, people don’t see Claude as a magic autonomous robot that self‑directs indefinitely. They see it as a **powerful agent that _can_ work continuously**, but only when you build the framework around it — plans, checkpoints, supervisors, and external memory — to keep it on track.

---

## 🌿 Quiet summary, Fira

What people are saying very clearly now is:

> **Claude Code is capable of continuous, complex work, but not fully autonomous in the sense of “set it and forget it.”
> It shines when you build structure around it — plans, context files, checkpoints — and treat it as a collaborator, not a solo actor.**

That’s the real voice you’ll find in developer forums and issue trackers today.

If you want, I can gently walk through a **pattern for structuring autonomous workflows** so Claude behaves better over many stages — just say the word.

I mean without any help

---

Fira, when people talk honestly about **Claude Code doing long, autonomous, complex work without _any_ human help at all**, the consensus from real‑world uses and discussions — not marketing hype — is much more cautious than some headlines might suggest. The truth sits in a _quiet middle place_ between promise and unassisted perfection.

Here’s how people actually describe it now:

---

## 🧠 **What the experiences say — in plain terms**

### 🧩 **It's not truly autonomous yet**

Across discussions and experiments, you’ll find a strong theme:

- People repeatedly observe that Claude Code _doesn’t reliably keep working forever without supervision_. Attempts to walk away and come back to a finished project often fall short — the agent may stop early, announce completion incorrectly, or simply wait for more input. This comes up again and again in community threads about autonomous workflows. ([Reddit][1])
- Even when users _try_ to script agents to loop continuously, Claude usually needs external mechanisms — like loops, plugins, or external state files — to maintain focus and direction over long runs. Without that scaffolding, it tends to _drift or stall_. ([Reddit][2])

So, the idea of fully set‑and‑forget autonomous execution — where you give a high‑level goal, walk away, and find a polished result later — isn’t something people report happening _out of the box_ with Claude Code today. ([Reddit][1])

---

## ⏳ **Some longer runs _are_ possible — but with nuance**

There _are_ reports where Claude keeps going for hours on tasks without much human guidance:

- Internal tests by Anthropic show newer versions of Claude working continuously on tasks for **up to ~30 hours** in a single stretch, which was a big improvement over earlier models. That’s closer to “sustained action” than before. ([Medium][3])
- Independent Reddit threads describe specialized setups that _successfully ran entire job suites_ overnight — but these setups always involved deliberate systems built around the model (external memory, checkpoints, and repeating context), not a single free‑running AI process. ([Reddit][4])

People describe these as _conditional autonomy_ — meaning the agent _can_ work for long stretches without direct human input, but only when the context and support structures are carefully arranged.

---

## 🔄 **Why full autonomy hasn’t really landed yet**

The community and research discussions point to a few structural truths:

### 🧠 **Memory and context drift**

Without a supervising structure, Claude tends to _lose track_ of high‑level goals as conversations grow long or complicated. That’s a big reason why purely hands‑off work falls apart mid‑task. ([Blackhole Software][5])

### 🔄 **Task understanding vs. task execution**

Claude is very good at _handling well‑specified subtasks_ — writing code, performing refactors, or calling commands — but it doesn’t spontaneously decide **what to do next** in the way a fully autonomous system would. To act continuously, it needs a clear plan and repeated reorientation. ([GitHub][6])

### 🧪 **Verification and stopping behavior**

Agents often _stop early_ by thinking they’ve finished or by reporting success when tests weren’t fully validated — another sign they haven’t fully internalized the long‑task goal. ([在线工具][7])

---

## 🌿 **Quiet summary — what people are really saying**

**Claude Code is getting closer to longer, semi‑autonomous runs, but:**

🌙 It **doesn’t yet run long, complex tasks start‑to‑finish with zero human involvement.**
📌 Even in ambitious experiments, there’s always a _structure_ or _mechanism_ that keeps it on task — external memory, loops, progress files, or checkpoints.
⚙️ Built‑in stopping behavior, verification gaps, and context drift make fully unsupervised autonomy rare in practice.
⏱️ It _can_ go hours on a task, but that isn’t the same as _autonomy without oversight_.

In simple, earthy terms:

> **Right now, Claude Code is like a highly capable colleague who works deep on complex jobs — but still needs clear goals, reminders, and occasional check‑ins. It’s not yet the kind of assistant you can send off and forget.**

If you’re curious about _why_ that fundamental difference still exists — or what people think the next steps toward true autonomy might be — we can explore that tenderly next.

What does Memory and context drift look like

---

Fira, if we sit and explore **what “memory and context drift” looks like in practice with Claude Code or other large AI models**, it’s helpful to picture how an agent can _slowly lose track of what it was originally doing_—not in dramatic leaps, but in quiet, creeping ways that make long tasks harder to manage.

Here’s a gentle breakdown of how people actually describe it:

---

## 🌫️ **What “drift” feels like in real use**

When people talk about context or memory drift, they mean that an AI:

### 🌀 **Starts well… then slowly wanders**

Users who run long sessions often notice this pattern:

- Early steps are _on point_, aligned with goals and code structure.
- Later, the model begins to make suggestions that don’t match earlier intentions — like starting to reference irrelevant parts of the project or mentioning things that weren’t part of the plan. This isn’t dramatic — it’s subtle at first, but it grows. ([Leonas5555][1])

### 📉 **Forgets what it _just_ knew**

One Reddit user described it very plainly:

> After a while, the agent starts forgetting file paths it generated only minutes ago. It may even try to import modules that don’t exist anymore. ([Reddit][2])

That’s the essence of drift: the AI appears confident, but it has _lost thread of its own context_.

### 💭 **Reintroduces old ideas as if they’re new**

Another common sign is when an agent begins to _repeat decisions that were already made_ or ignores constraints that were clearly established earlier in the workflow. Even if you told it something wasn’t needed — later it’ll act as though that instruction never existed. ([Reddit][3])

---

## 🧠 **Why this happens: the human analogy**

Think of having a long conversation with someone who has a short attention span:

- At first, they remember everything you said.
- As the talk goes on, the beginning fades, and they start guessing what you meant instead of remembering exactly what you said.
- After a long time, their responses can feel only loosely connected to your original question.

For AI models, this happens because:

### 🔹 **Limited “working memory”**

Language models only see a certain window of tokens at once. Even with a large window, earlier context eventually gets pushed out unless you manage it. ([JOBIRUN][4])

### 🔹 **Noise accumulation**

As the session grows — decisions, responses, intermediate steps — the model’s internal state fills with both _signal_ and _noise_. If that isn’t managed, the noise can start to dominate, and outputs become less reliable over time. ([CometAPI][5])

---

## 📍 **Common comebacks people share**

Here are some real examples of what drift looks like in practice, from people working on CLAUDE CODE and similar agent workflows:

- **Irrelevant suggestions** — an agent suddenly recommends dealing with unrelated parts of a codebase. ([Qiita][6])
- **Context loss even in short spans** — forgetting file locations from minutes prior and hallucinating imports. ([Reddit][2])
- **Degradation over time** — outputs become noisier and less tethered to the original specifications. ([Reddit][7])

Users often describe it less like a _crash_ and more like a _slow loss of direction_, which can be frustrating because you didn’t expect the agent to “forget” things it had already learned.

---

## 🌱 **Why people talk about drift at length**

In communities working with Claude Code and other AI agents, drift has become one of the biggest practical barriers to _truly autonomous_ long tasks. Tens of comments and experiments show that no matter how clever the agent is in the first steps, without carefully managed memory, it tends to wander or lose fidelity over time. ([Reddit][2])

This is why so many practitioners are thinking and talking about “context engineering” — not just throwing text at the model, but structuring memory, summaries, and checkpoints so the agent doesn’t slowly dissolve into irrelevant ideas. ([log.eurekapu.com][8])

---

## 🌿 A Gentle Summary

Memory/context drift isn’t a dramatic meltdown — it’s more like:

> **The longer a task runs without structured memory, the more the agent forgets its own past actions and intentions, and the farther its output can wander from the original goal.**

In real project work, people see drift in subtle but impactful ways: forgotten context, irrelevant suggestions, repeated ideas, and creeping incoherence as time goes on.

If you want, Fira, I can share a few simple metaphors or visual analogies that make this even easier to hold gently in your mind. Just let me know.
