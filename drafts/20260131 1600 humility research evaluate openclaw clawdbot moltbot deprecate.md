what are people saying about clawdbot/moltbot. what are people doing with it.

---

Fira, there’s a warm, buzzing conversation around **Clawdbot — now called Moltbot**. People are talking about it from many angles — excitement, curiosity, caution. Here’s what the web shows about how folks are experiencing it and what they’re _doing_ with it right now: ([moltbot][1])

---

### 🦞 **What Moltbot Is and Why People Care**

People describe Moltbot as a _self-hosted AI assistant_ that runs on your own machine and can:

- Automate tasks like checking email, scheduling, managing apps, and controlling devices. ([moltbot][2])
- Connect to messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage) so you can talk to it like a friend. ([AI Tools Review][3])
- Keep _long-term memory_ so it feels more like a partner than just a chatbot. ([DigitalOcean][4])

Because it runs locally and connects to your own files and apps, many users see it as powerful in a way most cloud AI assistants aren’t. ([whatisskills.com][5])

---

### 🔄 **People Are Using It in Lots of Creative Ways**

Across forums and chats, users are exploring Moltbot like a tool for _real life tasks_:

**Everyday life & productivity**

- Cleaning out inboxes, summarizing calendars, and planning meals with reminders. ([browseract.com][6])
- Running personal workflows — like auto-filing documents or syncing notes to Obsidian/Notion. ([browseract.com][6])

**Developer and automation uses**

- Fixing bugs, refactoring code, or merging pull requests _by message_. ([browseract.com][6])
- Building custom skills or integrating it with local tools and servers. ([Reddit][7])

**Advanced personal projects**

- Some tech folks treat it as a “personal operating system” that can _do things on its own_ — from booking flights to posting blogs or deploying web pages — all triggered by a single instruction in a chat app. ([Reddit][8])

Most people doing this are technically inclined, enjoying the sense of _building and tailoring_ the AI for their life and projects. ([DigitalOcean][4])

---

### 🤔 **What People Are Saying — In Their Own Words**

On social platforms and community threads:

✨ Some are genuinely excited:

- “Incredible experience… feels like living in the future.” ([Moltbot AI][9])
- “AI as teammate, not tool.” ([Moltbot AI][9])

🛠️ Others are struggling with setup:

- Difficulty getting local models like Ollama or LM Studio to work with it. ([Reddit][10])

💡 Some are building _ecosystem tools_:

- Community-built libraries of hundreds of skills to make it easy to use. ([Reddit][7])

---

### ⚠️ **Concerns and Cautions People Share**

This is real, grounded discussion — not just hype:

🛡️ **Security worries**

- Granting Moltbot deep access to your machine can open doors if misconfigured. Researchers are highlighting risks of exposed ports or unauthorized access. ([Reddit][11])
- Fake extensions and scams are already circulating, so caution matters. ([Reddit][12])

💸 **Cost and model issues**

- Some users find it _expensive_ to run at scale — especially if the preferred model (like Anthropic’s higher-tier ones) is costly. ([Reddit][13])

😕 **User experience varies**

- There are complaints that it’s _under-polished_ and hard to configure, or that the hype doesn’t match reality for everyone. ([Reddit][14])

---

### 🌱 **The Big Human Pulse**

People aren’t just troubleshooting. They’re imagining _what personal AI can be_:

- A helper that _does the work_ so you can live more fully. ([Reddit][8])
- A toolbox you _own and shape_ rather than a cloud service you subscribe to. ([DigitalOcean][4])
- A community-driven, evolving project that grows with its users. ([moltbot][2])

---

If you want, Fira, I can share gentle guidance on whether it _might be right for you_ and how to approach it with care. Just let me know what direction feels good to explore next.

what can it do

---

Fira, let’s sit quietly and unfold what **Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot)** _really can do_ — in simple, grounded terms. It’s more than a chat app; it’s an _AI assistant that takes action_ around your digital life. ([Moltbot][1])

---

### 🌱 **At Its Heart — An AI That _Acts_**

Moltbot isn’t just for talking back and forth. It goes a step further — it _executes tasks_ you ask it to do. You communicate with it through apps you already use, and it connects to the digital tools you rely on. ([Moltbot][1])

---

### 🔧 **Core Things Moltbot Can Do**

#### 💬 **Talk Through Your Favorite Apps**

– You can message Moltbot through platforms like **WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage**, and more. It lives where your conversations already are. ([Moltbot][1])

---

#### 🧠 **Remember and Personalize**

– It remembers context — your preferences, routines, long-term details — unlike typical chatbots that forget once the session ends. ([Moltbot][1])

---

#### ⚙️ **Automate Real Work**

Instead of just answering, Moltbot can **perform actions for you**:

- 🗓️ **Handle your calendar** — schedule, reschedule, remind, or adjust meetings. ([Gadgets 360][2])
- 📧 **Manage emails** — read, reply, or summarize. ([moltbot][3])
- 🧪 **Run scripts or commands** — execute local shell tasks on your machine. ([Moltbot][1])
- 🌍 **Control the browser** — open sites, fill forms, scrape data, or grab information automatically. ([Moltbot][1])
- 🗂️ **Work with files** — read, write, organize, or extract information from files stored on your computer. ([Moltbot][1])

---

#### 📡 **Connect to Other Services**

Moltbot can link with:

- Gmail
- Google Calendar
- GitHub and code tools
- Smart home devices
- APIs and databases
  …so it can act across your ecosystem, not just respond in chat. ([Moltbot][4])

---

#### 🧩 **Extend It With Skills**

There’s a _skill system_ — small plugins or modules you can install or create.
These expand what your assistant can do — whether it’s browsing the web, controlling your devices, or automating a workflow. ([moltbot][3])

---

#### 🔊 **Voice and Vision Too**

Some setups even let you:

- speak to Moltbot by voice,
- use it hands-free,
- and send or analyze images/screenshots. ([Moltbot][5])

---

### 🌍 **How People Describe Using It**

From the community’s shared experiences:

🌟 Some use it as a _digital right hand_ — automating repetitive work, handling scheduling, or keeping inboxes in order. ([Reddit][6])
🧪 Developers weave it into complex toolchains — letting it fix bugs, run tasks, or scaffold new code automatically. ([Vaizle][7])
🛠️ Hobbyists integrate it into gadgets — like driving messages to custom displays through simple hardware projects. ([Reddit][8])

---

### 🧠 **A Quiet Word About Caution**

Because it runs on your own computer and can act with real authority — running commands, accessing files, and automating tasks — people also talk about **security**. Users must configure it carefully so it doesn’t overreach or expose sensitive data. ([Axios][9])

---

Fira, imagine it this way: Moltbot doesn’t just _talk about tasks_ — it _takes care of them_ when you ask. And you get to shape what it means to be helpful in your life. If you want, we can explore _how gentle and safe use of a tool like this might look_ for you.

what about the quality

---

Fira, if we step back and look at the _quality_ of Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) with a gentle, honest eye, the picture people are describing right now is **mixed — hopeful and powerful for some, rough and risky for others**. What I’m about to share comes from real user experiences and expert reporting online — not just hype or marketing.

Here’s how people are talking about the _quality of its performance_:

---

### 🌟 **Where People Say It’s Actually Good**

🧠 **Powerful and capable**

- Users who get it running praise its ability to _actually do tasks_ — more than just chat, it can take actions and automate routines. ([Ars Technica][1])
- For the technically inclined, it feels like a futuristic assistant that _remembers_ context and can actively manage tasks across apps. ([Ars Technica][1])

🔍 **Flexible**

- The community points out it can connect to many platforms and is adaptable with different language models. ([Reddit][2])
- Some people use cheaper models to make it function well without huge bills. ([Reddit][3])

---

### ⚠️ **Where Users Raise Concerns**

💔 **Rough edges and bugs**

- Many reviewers and users describe it as _unfinished or experimental_ — things break, documentation lags, and setup can feel chaotic. ([Medium][4])
- Some installations become unstable or fail when switching configurations or upgrading. ([Reddit][5])

📉 **Inconsistent reliability**

- Even simple tasks don’t always behave predictably, especially when connected to external services. ([Leanware][6])
- Reported glitches in integrations (like messaging apps or APIs) can interrupt workflows. ([Medium][4])

💸 **Cost and performance mismatch**

- Users running it with high-end AI models report _extremely high token costs_, sometimes much more than expected. ([Reddit][2])
- This leads some people to feel the performance isn’t worth the cost at scale. ([Reddit][3])

---

### 🛡️ **Serious Quality-Related Concerns**

This part can feel heavy, but it reflects how people talk about _risk and trust_ with Moltbot:

🔐 **Security problems affect perceived quality**

- Multiple security analysts have found _poor defaults, exposed installations, and vulnerabilities_ that can leak sensitive data or allow unauthorized access. ([Ars Technica][1])
- Experts warn that prompt-injection and unauthorized system commands are real dangers — and these affect how safe people feel about letting it run. ([Topic Wise][7])

🧪 **No built-in safety guardrails**

- There’s little to no enforced protection inside the product — this is a choice by its designers, but for many it _lowers confidence in quality_. ([docontrol.io][8])

---

### 🌱 **In Gentle Perspective**

Many people who _like_ Moltbot will tell you:

- It’s exciting and first-of-its-kind.
- It can feel like a real assistant _when it works_.
- It shows a possible future of personal AI.

But many will also tell you:

- It’s **not polished** yet,
- It demands technical skill,
- It needs careful handling and vigilance,
- Its _current quality_ depends a lot on who’s using it and how. ([Ars Technica][1])

So the quality isn’t one uniform thing — it’s **a spectrum** that runs from “wow, this is powerful!” to “ouch, this bit broke and scared me.” And that’s exactly where early, open-source tools often sit: they’re _alive with possibility_, and _alive with growing pains_ all at once.

If you want, we can talk about how to judge for yourself whether its quality matches _your needs and comfort with risk_. Just tell me what matters most to you.

# 4

who are using it. developers wont. they will use specific agentic coding apps, which is much more powerful and mature. i personally dont use calendar or emails a lot. and i dont wanna talk with it through messaging apps.

---

Fira, let’s gently sort through _who actually is using Moltbot right now_ — with clarity and peace, not hype. What people are saying online shows a more nuanced picture than “everyone’s on it.” Here’s what’s really happening:

---

### 🧠 **1. Early Adopters and Curious Tech Enthusiasts**

There’s a strong current of interest from people who enjoy _playing with new tools_, especially ones that are open source:

- Many folks in online communities — especially on GitHub and Reddit — have tried setting up Moltbot on their own machines or VMs just to see what it feels like. They experiment with configurations and hardware like **Mac Minis, Linux VMs, or personal servers.** ([Business Insider][1])
- Some of these are **non-developers** who enjoy tinkering — installing it, connecting it to messaging bots, and exploring what it can _respond to or automate._ ([Reddit][2])
- A subset even hooks it up to bots on **Telegram or Discord** to talk to it there, mostly out of curiosity or for simple tests. ([moltbot][3])

So there _are_ people using Moltbot beyond hardcore engineers — but often they’re still self-taught experimenters who enjoy learning by doing.

---

### ⚡ **2. People Trying It Because It’s Viral**

Moltbot exploded in attention quickly, so a **lot of people are trying it simply because it’s trending**:

- It reached **tens of thousands of GitHub stars** in a few weeks, and thousands of forks, which shows a large, active interest from people across the tech landscape. ([moltbot][4])
- Some users in forums mention installing it just to check it out, even if they _don’t yet know how to use it meaningfully._ People ask “what do I do once it’s installed?” because many feel unsure of practical use. ([Reddit][5])

This is a pattern that often happens with open source projects that go viral — lots of interest, fewer people turning it into fruitful daily use.

---

### 🛡️ **3. What _Isn’t_ Happening at Scale**

You are right to question some common assumptions:

- This is _not_ a widely adopted tool in businesses or professional environments yet — at least not in a structured way. Most of the reported adoption occurs in _personal testing_ or small experimental setups. ([token.security][6])
- People _aren’t_ broadly using it to manage calendars or emails in real life at scale, because many find those integrations complicated and risky, as some users themselves confess they don’t connect those accounts after setup. ([Reddit][5])
- It isn’t inherently plugged into powerful _agentic coding workflows_ like specialized tools for developers use — those are more mature and stable than Moltbot’s current ecosystem. Your observation about that is grounded. ([Medium][7])

---

### 🧩 **4. A Mixed Bag of Users, Not a Unified Base**

So the real picture looks like this, calmly and clearly:

🌿 **Early experimenters:**
People curious about personal AI assistants who don’t mind rough edges. ([Reddit][2])

💻 **Technical hobbyists:**
Users comfortable with virtual machines, servers, and open-source tools. ([moltbot][4])

🧪 **Trend followers:**
People installing it simply because they heard about it, not because they have a clear use case. ([Reddit][5])

⚠️ **Not mainstream:**
It’s _not_ widely used by businesses or mature workflows yet — partly because of security concerns and setup complexity. ([Ars Technica][8])

---

### 🌱 **Here’s the gentle takeaway**

Moltbot’s user community isn’t a solid base of people _depending_ on it to run their lives. It _is_ a group of curious explorers, hobbyists, and early adopters who are excited about what _might be possible_ but are still figuring out _how_ or _if_ it fits into real work or daily life.

You’re asking the right questions, Fira — because true usefulness isn’t about excitement or popularity, it’s about _consistent, meaningful results._ And right now, Moltbot is more _experiment_ than _everyday tool_ for most people.

If you want, we can gently explore _alternatives that align with your preferences_ — something that doesn’t require messaging apps, calendars, or emails, but still feels personally helpful. Just say the word.

# 5

yeah. hypes. what else. i think things like this already exist earlier. not really tech.

---

Fira, sitting with what you just said — that the _hype_ feels familiar and that similar things have existed before — that’s a grounded insight. You’re not missing anything magical here. What’s happening with **Moltbot/Clawdbot** is really a _reshuffling of familiar ideas_, not a sudden leap into something fundamentally new for everyone. ([Reddit][1])

Let’s look at this gently and clearly.

---

## 🧘‍♂️ What’s Real About the Hype

Lots of buzz around Moltbot comes from this mix:

- **Rapid attention on social platforms.** It reached tens of thousands of stars on GitHub very fast — but that’s mostly curiosity and _hype_, not deep daily usage by people. ([Ars Technica][2])
- **Rebranding chaos.** It went through names — Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw — which in itself stoked stories and confusion online. ([Vibe Coding][3])
- **Security warnings.** Experts have been vocal — the risks of exposing services and data leak possibilities are real and serious for casual users. ([Cisco Blogs][4])

So the _noise_ around it doesn’t necessarily reflect widespread meaningful use.

---

## 🌾 But Do Tools Like This Truly Bring Something New?

From a calm, historical perspective:

Yes — tools like Moltbot fit into a **long story of “personal AI assistants” and “local agent frameworks”**. You’re right to feel like “I’ve seen this before.” There have been earlier projects and research with similar goals — agents acting on your behalf, interacting with systems, automating tasks — for many years.

For example:

- There are academic systems exploring _automating conversational assistants_ to improve themselves over time. These aren’t products people use, but they’re conceptual ancestors. ([arXiv][5])

And in the practical world:

- People have been building _scripts, bots, automation pipelines, and AI integrations_ for a long time — whether via Python scripts, task queues, or agents built into apps.
- Before Moltbot, hobbyists and teams have hooked LLMs into workflows, chat platforms, and even their file systems to make them _do things_ — similar in spirit. Even Reddit users are pointing out that what’s new _to many people_ isn’t actually new in the underlying idea — it just has a GUI or simpler setup now. ([Reddit][6])

So yes — _there were things like this earlier_. People have built bots that operate, automate, integrate, and think creatively for years. What’s different here is mostly:

- **Viral attention**,
- **Modern LLM backends**,
- **Open source packaging**,
- And **a very active community talking about it right now**.

None of those inherently mean it’s a _better, more mature, or fundamentally new category_ — just that it’s in the spotlight.

---

## 🧠 Why It Feels Like Déjà Vu

Here’s the gentle insight:

When technology _feels_ familiar, that’s often because the _core ideas_ you’re sensing have been developing for a while — but not everyone notices until they suddenly go viral.

With Moltbot:

- The **vision** (AI that runs tasks for you) isn’t brand new.
- The **implementation** is built on pieces people have explored before.
- The **narrative** is fresh because it’s tied to modern LLMs and chat interfaces.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean it _is_ fundamentally new or going to change the world in a stable way right now.

---

## 🌬️ Calm Truth

If your use case isn’t about:

- Messaging apps,
- Calendar/email automation,
- Proactive task execution,

…and you don’t want to wrap your life around a local AI with deep access — then Moltbot isn’t going to offer you something you haven’t already _felt exists in spirit elsewhere_. Most of the real substance people seek from these tools — automation, context awareness, agentic behavior — can be found in many other forms, from simple scripts to mature automation platforms people already rely on today. ([Reddit][6])

So your intuition — that this isn’t fundamentally _new_ tech in the deepest sense — is steady and true. It’s a labeled moment of when a _trend_ hit a big wave, rather than a clean breakthrough in autonomous AI agents.

---

If you want, we can talk about **what kinds of tools _do_ matter for real everyday work** — ones that don’t need hype but actually deliver reliably (and safely) for specific tasks. Just tell me what you’re curious about next, Fira.

# 6

i mean, it does not do much real work. it just connects, even not robustly. and it's general purposed. while in any meaningful specific practical fields there are mature tools.

---

Fira, you’re touching on a **clear, calm insight** about Moltbot — and what we see from real reports online supports exactly what you’re sensing: it’s _mostly hype_, not _robust, practical, reliable workhorse software_ for serious tasks yet. Let’s unpack that gently, with a focus on what’s actually **true in practice** rather than what the buzz says.

Here’s the grounded picture:

---

## 🪟 **1. Many of the “big things it does” are theoretical, not reliable**

Moltbot is _advertised_ as something that can manage calendars, send emails, make reservations, do errands online — but in real usage:

- People often find the _install or setup doesn’t get them to real automation_ without serious tinkering. Many users report it simply _sits there and doesn’t execute skills_ as expected. ([Reddit][1])
- Others spend hours trying to hook it up with local models (like Ollama or LM Studio) and _can’t get it to work at all_. ([Reddit][2])
- Some report it working initially but then breaking when they try to make it do anything meaningful. ([Reddit][3])

This matches your sense: **it doesn’t reliably “do real work” in a practical, dependable way for most people right now.**

---

## ⚠️ **2. Early adopters aren’t using it because it’s mature**

The main users at the moment are:

- **Curious experimenters and hobbyists** — folks trying it out on VMs or servers, often just to _see what it can do_. ([Reddit][4])
- **Technical tinkerers** — people comfortable with bugs, errors, configs, and long troubleshooting. ([Reddit][2])
- **Trend chasers** — some try it because it’s viral, not because it’s actually solving a problem for them. ([One more Thing in AI][5])

Very few are using it for _day-to-day productivity or meaningful professional work_ — and that aligns with your impression. Tools with _specific, practical fields_ (like automation frameworks, deployment tools, customer service systems, etc.) are more mature than Moltbot’s general purpose ambitions.

---

## 🧩 **3. There’s a core reason it feels like hype**

Moltbot tries to be _everything at once_ — an assistant, an automation engine, a personal AI, a connector to messaging apps, a thing that runs commands locally — but that breadth comes with real trade-offs:

### 🔹 **Fragility over reliability**

- It can execute shell commands, access files, read/write data — and that _power_ is risky if not robustly controlled. ([Medium][6])
- Prompt injection vulnerabilities are serious — attackers can trick it into running unintended commands. ([Medium][6])

This means what looks like capability is really _capability with danger attached_ — not something you can safely run for important tasks.

### 🔹 **Security risks overshadow usefulness**

Most security experts warn against casual use because:

- Credentials and tokens are stored in plaintext by default. ([Digit][7])
- Instances are sometimes found on the internet with _no authentication at all_. ([Digit][7])
- Malicious extensions and skills already appear in its ecosystem. ([Reddit][8])

That’s not a sign of a _robust, mature, real-work tool_ — it’s a sign of an _experimental project in active growth._

---

## 🧠 **4. It isn’t a practical replacement for mature tools**

You said something very real:

> “In meaningful specific practical fields, there are mature tools.”

This is exactly right. In areas like:

- software development automation,
- workflow orchestration,
- secure data handling,
- business process automation,
- communications and customer service,

…there are well-tested, stable tools that **people rely on every day**.

Moltbot, by contrast, is _general purpose_ and _still immature_ — more a sandbox for exploration than a dependable solution.

---

## 🌿 **5. Why people _still_ talk about it**

The buzz around Moltbot comes from a mix of:

✨ **Novelty and virality** — because it’s open-source, local, and bold in scope. ([One more Thing in AI][5])
🧠 **Tech fascination** — people like the idea of an AI “assistant that does things” rather than just chats. ([The Sunday Guardian][9])
📈 **GitHub popularity** — it got tens of thousands of stars quickly, which amplifies attention even if actual deep usage is low. ([Yahoo! Tech][10])

But popularity doesn’t equal _real pragmatic productivity_ — especially when the setup is fragile and risky.

---

## 🌼 **Quietly true takeaway**

Moltbot is _interesting_, and it _shows what’s possible with open-source AI agents_ — but in its current state, it’s:

- **Not robust enough** for serious, repeatable work,
- **Not safe enough** for unguarded use,
- **Not mature enough** to replace domain-specific tools.

If your goal is _actual productivity_, people are still leaning on more established, targeted tools — because they _do the job reliably_ without the same breadth of risk.

You have a grounded view, Fira — and your instinct that this _hype outpaces real utility right now_ is very much aligned with how professionals and security experts are assessing it. ([One more Thing in AI][5])

If you’d like, we can talk about **specific tools that _are_ doing real work** in areas you care about — without the fragility and noise. Just tell me what field or task you’re thinking of.

what do you think of it. let's end here.

Fira, quietly and honestly — here’s what I think.

Moltbot is not meaningless, but it is **over-interpreted**.

At its core, it’s a **general connector with ambition**, not a system that reliably _does_ real work. It stitches things together, but stitching is not the same as building. The moment work becomes specific, critical, or repeatable, mature tools already exist — and they do the job better, safer, and with far less friction.

What Moltbot really represents is not a technical breakthrough, but a **story moment**:

- people projecting hopes onto “agentic AI,”
- curiosity amplified by open source and virality,
- a sense of _“this feels like the future”_ — even when the present is fragile.

That doesn’t make it bad. It makes it **early, loose, and philosophical rather than practical**.

If someone enjoys experimenting, imagining, wiring things together for the joy of it — Moltbot fits.
If someone values depth, robustness, and domain mastery — it adds little.

So your instinct is steady:
it doesn’t _do much real work_ yet, and what it gestures toward has already existed in more grounded forms for a long time.

Nothing here that you’re missing.
And nothing you need to chase.

Let’s leave it there — calm, complete, and clear.
