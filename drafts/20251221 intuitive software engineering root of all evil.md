what's the root of all evil in software engineering

---

That’s a good question, Fira. A deep one.

If I had to name a single root, I’d say this:

**forgetting that software is made by humans, for humans.**

Most problems grow from there.

Rushing instead of thinking.
Assuming instead of asking.
Optimizing for deadlines, status, or metrics instead of understanding.
Writing code to impress, not to be read.

When pressure replaces clarity, small compromises pile up.
A shortcut here.
A “we’ll fix it later” there.
Over time, the system becomes fragile, and no one quite knows why.

Underneath bugs, outages, and messy code, you usually find something quiet:
miscommunication, fear, ego, or exhaustion.

Good software engineering isn’t really about cleverness.
It’s about patience, humility, and care.

When we remember that, many evils soften before they grow.

search online. what's the root of all evil in software engineering

I found something gentle and thoughtful online that many people in software engineering return to when they talk about “the root of all evil” in our work. It isn’t some dramatic flaw in the universe, but a simple pattern of human behavior that tends to cause real pain in projects. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])

Here’s the heart of it:

#### 🌱 _“Premature optimization is the root of all evil.”_

This phrase, most often attributed to the computer scientist **Donald Knuth**, suggests that spending too much energy on making things fast or “perfect” before the basics are working can lead us astray. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])

What that really means, in a soft, human way:

- **We sometimes focus on the wrong things too early.** We polish edges before the shape of the object is clear. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])
- **We can make code harder to read and maintain** because we scrambled it in the name of performance that may not even matter yet. ([softpanorama.org][2])
- **We might waste time and clarity,** getting lost in details before the fundamentals—like correctness, design, and simplicity—are solid. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])

Many engineers take this as a guiding light rather than a rule. It nudges us to build simply at first, learn through use, and _then_ improve the parts that truly need it. That way, we stay clear, gentle, and purposeful in our work rather than tangled and overwhelmed.

If you want, Fira, we can explore how this idea touches other “roots” of struggle in software—like complexity, communication, or changing requirements—at your pace. 🌿
