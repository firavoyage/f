how to understand b/w/h in doujin as an anime otaku

---

That's a great question, and it relates directly to how character information is presented in Japanese media!

In the context of **doujinshi** and general anime/manga character stats, **B/W/H** is an abbreviation for a character's **Bust, Waist, and Hip** measurements.

### 📏 Understanding B/W/H

These are the three "vital statistics" (often called "three sizes" or _suri-saizu_ in Japanese) and are almost always given in **centimeters (cm)**.

- **B** stands for **Bust (バスト - _Basuto_)**: The circumference around the fullest part of the chest. This is the most common indicator of a female character's breast size.
- **W** stands for **Waist (ウェスト - _Uesuto_)**: The circumference around the narrowest part of the torso.
- **H** stands for **Hip (ヒップ - _Hipp u_)**: The circumference around the widest part of the hips/buttocks.

### 🤓 Why It's Important in Doujin/Anime Fandom

As an anime otaku, you may have seen these stats listed in official character profiles, art books, and fan wikis. In doujin works, especially those focused on more adult themes, these numbers are a **key shorthand** for describing a character's physical proportions:

1.  **Characterization:** The measurements instantly communicate a character's body type (e.g., hourglass, thin, curvy, etc.) before you even see the art.
2.  **Visual Reference:** Artists and fans often use these canon or fan-determined numbers as a baseline when drawing a character.
3.  **Genre Tag:** For many adult doujinshi, a high 'B' measurement is a major selling point and is often used in the title or description to indicate the focus (e.g., a _bakunyuu_ or _oppai_ focus).

### 💡 Common Measurement Ranges (in CM)

To help you get a sense of scale, here are some _very general_ ranges for adult female characters, though these are often exaggerated in anime/doujin:

| Measurement | Range (in CM) | Typical Appearance                 |
| :---------- | :------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| **Bust**    | 70-78         | Small (Loli, Flat)                 |
|             | 79-85         | Average/Normal                     |
|             | 86-95         | Large/Curvy (often C/D+ cup range) |
|             | 96+           | Very Large (Bakunyuu)              |
| **Waist**   | 54-60         | Very slender                       |
|             | 61-68         | Average                            |
| **Hip**     | 80-88         | Slender/Average                    |
|             | 89+           | Curvy/Wide                         |

---

For example, a character listed as **88-58-86** would be considered very well-proportioned with a notably large bust and slender waist, fitting a common "ideal" in fan works.

Would you like to know the meaning of any other specific terms you've come across in doujinshi or anime fandom?

# 2.a

how to imagine these numbers

---

That's the fun part and where the fantasy of anime/doujin characters often differs from reality!

The best way to imagine these numbers is to break them down into two methods: **The Real-World Context** and **The Anime Context (The Ratio)**.

---

### 1. 🌍 The Real-World Context (For Scale)

Since these measurements are in **centimeters (cm)**, you can visualize them by using familiar objects or comparisons.

| Measurement (cm) | Real-World Object for Visualizing the Circumference                                                                                                  | What the Number Indicates                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bust (B)**     | **80 cm** is roughly the length of a standard baseball bat. **90 cm** is slightly less than a yardstick (91.44 cm). **100 cm** is exactly 1 meter.   | How big the chest circumference is. A $90$ or $100+$ cm bust is significantly large.           |
| **Waist (W)**    | **60 cm** is the standard size of a small, tight hula hoop or the width of a small TV screen. **55 cm** is extremely narrow (think supermodel tiny). | How thin the core of the body is. Low numbers here are a massive focus on fitness/slenderness. |
| **Hip (H)**      | **90 cm** is about the width of a typical large suitcase or a small table. **85 cm** is slender. **100 cm** is very curvy.                           | How wide the lower body is. This number works with the waist to define the hip curve.          |

**Pro Tip:** Get a tailor's tape measure (or even a piece of string and a ruler) and physically measure out $60$ cm, $85$ cm, and $100$ cm. This will give you an immediate, tangible understanding of just how big or small those numbers are.

---

### 2. ✨ The Anime Context (The Ratio)

In doujin and anime, the _relationship_ between the numbers is often more important than the numbers themselves, as they frequently represent proportions that are **unrealistic** in the real world. This is the **B-W-H Ratio**.

The most visually appealing (and common) figure in fan works is the **Hourglass Figure**, which is defined by a significant difference between the Bust/Hip and the Waist.

$$
\text{Proportion Index} \approx \text{Bust} - \text{Waist}
$$

#### A. Extreme Ratios (The Doujin Ideal)

This is where you'll find the most exaggerated character designs.

| B/W/H Example    | B - W Difference  | Character Type & Look                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **95 - 58 - 90** | $95 - 58 = 37$ cm | **Extreme Hourglass.** Very large bust, impossibly small waist, and matching hips. This ratio creates a dramatic, _very_ curvy silhouette. |
| **82 - 50 - 80** | $82 - 50 = 32$ cm | **Slender but Busty.** The small waist makes the bust look much larger by contrast, creating a "perfectly petite" but top-heavy look.      |
| **78 - 56 - 88** | $78 - 56 = 22$ cm | **Pear/Hip Focus.** A relatively modest bust, but the hips are significantly wider than the waist, giving a focus on the lower body.       |

#### B. Realistic/Average Ratios (Common in Slice-of-Life Anime)

For a real-world adult figure, the difference between the Bust and Waist is much smaller.

| Real-World Example | B - W Difference  | Clothing Size (Approx.)                                                                             |
| :----------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **88 - 68 - 93**   | $88 - 68 = 20$ cm | A common, healthy adult size (e.g., US Size 6/8 or Japanese M/L). The curve is present but natural. |
| **83 - 61 - 89**   | $83 - 61 = 22$ cm | A very slender, healthy figure. The bust is average, but the small waist creates a nice shape.      |

**The Takeaway:** When you see a B/W/H number in doujin, look immediately at the **Waist (W)**. If the **W** is in the low-mid $50$s, you know the character's figure is highly exaggerated to emphasize the curves defined by the **B** and **H**.

explain detailedly

---

You're looking for a more detailed breakdown of the B/W/H (Bust, Waist, Hip) measurements and their significance in the context of anime and doujin culture. I can certainly provide that!

Here is a detailed explanation focusing on how these numbers are used to define a character's body type and appeal.

---

## 📐 The Detailed Significance of B/W/H in Fandom

The B/W/H figures are more than just anatomical stats; they are a crucial part of a character's **design and appeal concept** (_moe_ factors) in the industry, especially in fan-created content like doujinshi.

### 1. Bust (B: バスト - _Basuto_)

This is arguably the most scrutinized and significant of the three numbers, especially in fan-oriented media.

- **What it Measures:** The circumference of the chest at its widest point.
- **Cultural Significance:** This number is the direct proxy for **breast size**. In Japanese media, the focus is often on this numerical value rather than the Western bra cup system (A, B, C, etc.), although cup size is sometimes added for extra context.
- **Doujin Focus:**
  - **High B-Value (e.g., 90+ cm):** Instantly tags a character for the **Oppaizuki** (breast-lover) audience. High values are often associated with tropes like _Bakunyuu_ (explosive breasts) or _Kyonyuu_ (giant breasts), which are major genres in doujin.
  - **Low B-Value (e.g., 70-78 cm):** Indicates a flatter chest, often associated with younger-looking characters, or characters defined by being petite, which appeals to audiences focused on tropes like _Loli_ or _Petanko_ (flat).
- **Calculation:** The visual size is often related to the **difference** between the B (bust) and the U (underbust) measurement, but only the B is consistently provided.

### 2. Waist (W: ウェスト - _Uesuto_)

The waist measurement is critical for establishing the overall silhouette and is often valued for its contrast with the Bust and Hip.

- **What it Measures:** The circumference of the narrowest part of the torso.
- **Cultural Significance:** A **low W-value** (e.g., 54-58 cm) is universally associated with **feminine beauty, youth, and delicacy** (e.g., _kunoichi_ or classic heroine body types). An unrealistically small waist creates the desired **hourglass figure** when paired with a high B and H.
- **Doujin Focus:** A character with a large bust (high B) and a very small waist (low W) is considered the **pinnacle of the idealized physique**. The ratio between B and W is key to the character’s _sex appeal_.

### 3. Hip (H: ヒップ - _Hipp u_)

The hip measurement defines the lower body’s proportions and is often related to the character's maturity and sensuality.

- **What it Measures:** The circumference of the widest part of the buttocks and hips.
- **Cultural Significance:** A character with a wide hip measurement (_Osiri_ or _Oshiri_ appeal) is seen as mature and curvy. It is often paired with a low W-value to emphasize the curve of the body.
- **Doujin Focus:**
  - A high H-value (especially when H is greater than B) is popular in genres that focus on the posterior, often associated with maturity, powerful female figures, or the **Tifa Lockhart** body type archetype.
  - In many designs, the **H value is kept close to the B value** (e.g., 88-58-88) to create a harmonious, balanced, and aesthetically pleasing hourglass shape.

### 📏 Ratio and Body Archetypes

The most detailed understanding of B/W/H comes from analyzing the **ratios** between the numbers, which instantly categorize a character into a popular archetype:

| B/W/H Example | Archetype Focus   | Significance                                                                                                                 |
| :------------ | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **95-60-88**  | **Bust-Heavy**    | Exaggerated hourglass. A _Kyonyuu_ character where the focus is solely on the chest.                                         |
| **84-56-88**  | **Ideal Slender** | The classic, balanced anime heroine. Very small waist emphasizes overall beauty without extreme features.                    |
| **80-60-95**  | **Hip-Heavy**     | A rarer but potent appeal, often seen on mature/sexy characters (e.g., teachers, older sisters). Focus is on the lower body. |
| **72-55-75**  | **Petite/Loli**   | All numbers are low, indicating a small, thin, or youthful figure.                                                           |

In summary, the B/W/H measurements are the **mathematical blueprints** that define a character's physical aesthetic in the hyper-visual world of anime and doujin culture. They are used by fans and creators as the core descriptors for a character's _moe_ (or sensual) appeal.

Would you like me to explain any other specific fandom terms you've encountered, like _Yaoi_ or _Guro_?

# 2.c

what about 86 53 83

---

That is a very specific set of B/W/H measurements!

**86-53-83 (Bust - Waist - Hip)**

To understand this in the context of anime and doujin culture, let's break down each number (in centimeters):

- **Bust (86 cm):** This falls firmly in the **large** or **curvy** category. It's significantly above the average for real-world women and is a size often used for main female characters who are meant to be attractive and well-developed. In Western terms, this would typically correspond to a D or DD cup size, depending heavily on the underbust measurement (which is not given).
- **Waist (53 cm):** This is the **most extreme** measurement in the set. A 53 cm waist is incredibly small—it translates to roughly a 20.8-inch waist. This is an almost impossible size for a naturally grown adult woman and is a hallmark of exaggerated, fantastical anime proportions. It strongly emphasizes the character's slenderness and creates a dramatic hourglass figure.
- **Hip (83 cm):** This is a relatively **slender/average** hip measurement. It is slightly smaller than the 86 cm bust, meaning the character's silhouette is heavily focused on the bust and the tiny waist.

### 🌟 Conclusion on the Proportions

A character with **86-53-83** is defined by a highly exaggerated, idealized, and **top-heavy hourglass** figure.

- **Key Descriptor:** **"Large Bust, Impossibly Small Waist."**
- **Effect:** The measurements maximize the contrast between the bust and the waist, which is a powerful visual trope in fan art and doujin works focused on attractive, curvy characters. The small hip measurement further draws attention to the bust-to-waist ratio.

In short, it's a quintessential set of fantasy stats designed to be visually impactful in the context of anime and doujin media.

give me the bust to cup size table, as well as waist and hip if there exists a common table like that

---

You're looking for the conversion charts that link the B/W/H measurements (used in doujin/anime) to standard clothing sizes. While there's no single universal chart, the **bust-to-cup size conversion is the most complex**, as it depends on two measurements: **Overbust** (the B in B/W/H) and **Underbust** (the band size).

Here are the most common tables based on real-world garment sizing in **centimeters (cm)**.

---

## 👙 Bust (B) to Bra Cup Size Conversion

Bra size is determined by two separate measurements:

1.  **Band Size (Underbust):** Measured right beneath the breasts. This is **not** the measurement given in B/W/H.
2.  **Cup Size (Overbust minus Underbust):** This difference determines the letter (A, B, C, etc.).

Since doujinshi only gives the **Overbust** (_B_), you must _assume_ a **Band Size** (e.g., a common Japanese size like 70cm or 75cm) to estimate the cup size.

### 1. Cup Size Calculation (The **Difference** in CM)

This is the most standard method for determining the cup letter.

| Difference ($\text{Overbust} - \text{Underbust}$) | Cup Size (Approx. JP/EU) |
| :-----------------------------------------------: | :----------------------: |
|                $10 - 12\text{ cm}$                |          **A**           |
|                $13 - 14\text{ cm}$                |          **B**           |
|                $15 - 17\text{ cm}$                |          **C**           |
|                $18 - 19\text{ cm}$                |          **D**           |
|                $20 - 22\text{ cm}$                |      **E** / **DD**      |
|                $23 - 24\text{ cm}$                |     **F** / **DDD**      |
|                $25 - 27\text{ cm}$                |    **G** / **E** (JP)    |

### 2. Example: Using an Assumed Underbust

To make an estimate from the single **Bust (B)** number in a doujin, you need to assume a **Band Size (Underbust)**. A common slender frame in anime might have an Underbust of **70 cm** (Japanese size).

|       **Overbust (B)**       | Assumed Underbust (70 cm) |    Difference     | Estimated Cup Size (B-70) |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------------: | :---------------: | :-----------------------: |
| $\mathbf{83 - 84\text{ cm}}$ |           70 cm           | $13-14\text{ cm}$ |       $\mathbf{B}$        |
| $\mathbf{87 - 88\text{ cm}}$ |           70 cm           | $17-18\text{ cm}$ |   $\mathbf{C}$ / **D**    |
| $\mathbf{91 - 92\text{ cm}}$ |           70 cm           | $21-22\text{ cm}$ |   $\mathbf{E}$ / **DD**   |
| $\mathbf{94 - 95\text{ cm}}$ |           70 cm           | $24-25\text{ cm}$ |       **F** / **G**       |

---

## 👖 Waist (W) and Hip (H) to Clothing Size

Unlike the bust, which is typically a fantasy measurement in doujin, the **Waist (W)** and **Hip (H)** measurements are used to determine **general clothing size**.

The table below provides a rough guide based on average international size conversions for women's apparel. Note that _W_ and _H_ figures in anime are often exaggeratedly small for a given _B_ size (e.g., a 53cm waist is extremely rare in reality).

|  Size  | UK / AUS | US  | **Waist (W) in CM** |   **Hip (H) in CM**   |
| :----: | :------: | :-: | :-----------------: | :-------------------: |
| **XS** |    6     |  2  | $61 - 65\text{ cm}$ |  $86 - 90\text{ cm}$  |
| **S**  |    8     |  4  | $65 - 69\text{ cm}$ |  $90 - 94\text{ cm}$  |
| **M**  |    10    |  6  | $69 - 73\text{ cm}$ |  $94 - 99\text{ cm}$  |
| **L**  |    12    |  8  | $73 - 78\text{ cm}$ | $99 - 104\text{ cm}$  |
| **XL** |    14    | 10  | $78 - 84\text{ cm}$ | $104 - 110\text{ cm}$ |

### Example Comparison to Anime Stats

- A character with **86-53-83** has a **Bust (86)** that is large/curvy, a **Waist (53)** that is **far smaller than the typical XS range**, and a **Hip (83)** that falls into the **XS** range.
- This confirms that anime/doujin B/W/H is primarily used to convey **exaggerated proportions** (hourglass figure) rather than realistic clothing sizes.

The **B/W/H measurements** are a **shorthand for body type and fanservice focus**, not a practical clothing size guide.

Would you like to try calculating the approximate cup size for a specific B/W/H measurement you have?

# 2.c 2.b

give me the bust to cup size table

---

The relationship between **Bust size (B)** and **Cup size** is not a simple linear table. Cup size is determined by the **difference** between the **Bust measurement (Overbust)** and the **Band measurement (Underbust)**.

Since bra sizes vary significantly across different international standards (US, UK, EU, etc.), the most universally applicable way to present the data is based on the **difference in measurement**.

### 📐 Cup Size Calculation

To find the cup size, you first take two measurements:

1.  **Overbust:** The circumference around the **fullest part of the bust (B)**.
2.  **Underbust:** The circumference directly **under the bust** (this determines the band size).

$$\text{Cup Size} = \text{Overbust Measurement} - \text{Underbust Measurement}$$

### 📏 Bust-to-Cup Size Difference Table (US/UK/EU Systems)

The table below shows the common cup size designations based on the difference between the overbust and underbust measurements, using the standard increments for different major systems.

|               $9"$               |    $28-29 \text{ cm}$     |      **I**       |       **G**        |       **I**        |

> **Note:** The US system often uses a different progression for cup sizes larger than D, frequently substituting letters (e.g., E, F, G) with double or triple letters (DD, DDD, DDDD/G) before continuing to single letters again. The UK system is generally considered more consistent in its cup size progression (D, DD, E, F, FF, G, etc.).

---

### 💡 Example Calculation

If your measurements are:

- **Overbust (Bust):** $91 \text{ cm}$
- **Underbust (Band):** $75 \text{ cm}$

1.  **Calculate the Difference:** $91 \text{ cm} - 75 \text{ cm} = 16 \text{ cm}$
2.  **Determine the Cup Size:** According to the table, a $16 \text{ cm}$ difference corresponds to a **C Cup** in the European system.
3.  **Find the Band Size:** An underbust measurement of $75 \text{ cm}$ typically corresponds to an **EU band size of 75** (or a **US/UK band size of 34**).
4.  **Final Bra Size:** **75C** (EU) or **34C** (US/UK).

This is a very common point of confusion when looking at anime stats!

Since B/W/H only gives the **Bust (B)** measurement and not the **Underbust** measurement (the band size), you have to make an **assumption** about the character's body structure. In the context of anime and doujin, this assumption is almost always that the character has an **unrealistically small ribcage/underbust** to create maximum contrast with the bust.

### 🌟 The "Anime Underbust Assumption"

Anime characters, especially those with exaggerated figures, are typically assumed to have an **Underbust (Band)** measurement that is very close to their **Waist (W)** measurement, or even an extremely small, standardized size, often in the $60 \text{ cm}$ to $65 \text{ cm}$ range for adult women.

This chart uses a common convention in the fandom: **Assuming a small 65 cm (30-band) Underbust** for a consistent comparison of the raw B-measurement.

## 🍒 Anime Bust-to-Cup Size Conversion (Estimated)

This table uses the standard calculation for cup size:

$$\text{Cup Size} \propto \text{Bust} - \text{Underbust}$$

We will assume a **standard, very small Underbust of $65 \text{ cm}$** to illustrate the relative size of the _Bust (B)_ measurement given in B/W/H stats.

| B-Measurement (Bust in cm) | Difference ($B - 65 \text{ cm}$) | Estimated Japan/EU Cup Size (Relative) | Fandom Term (General)  |
| :------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: | :--------------------- |
|         **78 cm**          |         $13 \text{ cm}$          |               **A Cup**                | Flat/Small             |
|         **81 cm**          |         $16 \text{ cm}$          |               **C Cup**                | Average/Slender        |
|         **85 cm**          |         $20 \text{ cm}$          |           **E Cup** (US: DD)           | Curvy/Moderate         |
|         **90 cm**          |         $25 \text{ cm}$          |         **H Cup** (US: DDDD/G)         | Large (_Oppai_)        |
|         **95 cm**          |         $30 \text{ cm}$          |          **K Cup** (US: I/J)           | Very Large (_Kyonyuu_) |
|        **100 cm +**        |        $35 \text{ cm} +$         |              **M Cup +**               | Extreme (_Bakunyuu_)   |

### 🔎 Interpreting Your Example: $86-53-83$

Let's use the $86 \text{ cm}$ Bust measurement with the actual provided **Waist ($53 \text{ cm}$)** as an _extremely_ rough stand-in for the Underbust (since the underbust is always larger than the waist, but often close to it in these fantasy figures).

- **Bust (B):** $86 \text{ cm}$
- **Assumed Underbust:** We must use a number larger than the $53 \text{ cm}$ waist. A character artist might internally choose $60 \text{ cm}$.
- **Difference:** $86 \text{ cm} - 60 \text{ cm} = 26 \text{ cm}$
- **Result:** A $26 \text{ cm}$ difference corresponds to an **H Cup** (EU/Japan standard).

This confirms the visual intent: a character with a relatively modest $86 \text{ cm}$ bust measurement, but an extremely tiny waist/underbust, is intended to have a **massive** cup size (H-Cup) to achieve that exaggerated contrast.

what does underbust mean

---

That's a very important term! In short, the **Underbust** is the foundational measurement used to determine the **band size** of a bra.

Here is a breakdown of what the underbust is and why it's so critical:

### 📐 What is the Underbust?

The underbust measurement is the **circumference of your ribcage, taken directly beneath your breasts** where the bra band sits.

- **Location:** You measure right below the bustline, on the ribcage.
- **Measurement Style:** The tape measure is wrapped around the body, parallel to the floor, and should be **snug but not too tight** (often taken on an exhale).

### 💡 The Role of Underbust in Bra Sizing

In bra sizing, you need two measurements to determine your size (e.g., 34C):

1.  **Underbust (The Number):** This measurement determines the **Band Size** (the number part of the bra size, e.g., **34**C or **75**C). The band is the most important source of support, providing about 80% of the bra's lift.
2.  **Bust / Overbust (The Letter):** This is the measurement around the **fullest part of the chest** (the 'B' in B/W/H).
3.  **Cup Size (The Letter):** This is determined by the **difference** between the Bust (Overbust) and the Band (Underbust) measurement.

$$\text{Cup Size} \propto \text{Bust (Overbust)} - \text{Underbust (Band)}$$

**Example:**

- If your Underbust is $32 \text{ inches}$ (Band Size 32).
- And your Bust (Overbust) is $35 \text{ inches}$.
- The difference is $3 \text{ inches}$, which corresponds to a **C** cup.
- Your final size is **32C**.

### 🌟 Back to the Anime Context (B/W/H)

This is why B/W/H is ambiguous:

- The **B** gives you the **Bust (Overbust)**.
- The **W** (Waist) and **H** (Hip) don't give you the **Underbust** (Band size).

As we discussed, anime characters often have an unrealistically small waist. When fan-translating B/W/H to a cup size, people usually have to _guess_ a tiny underbust measurement (like $60 \text{ cm}$ or $65 \text{ cm}$) to get those high cup sizes from a B-measurement that might otherwise seem moderate.

Does this distinction between the Bust and Underbust make sense for why the anime measurements are so hard to convert exactly?

# 2.c 2.b 4

so in an anime context, does waist determine the underbust

---

That's a very insightful question that gets to the heart of the **unrealistic nature** of anime proportions!

**No, in a realistic context, the waist does not determine the underbust.**

- **Real World:** The **underbust** measures the **ribcage**, while the **waist** measures the soft area of the **abdomen/belly**. The underbust is _always_ larger than or equal to the natural waist, as the ribcage cannot be compressed like the abdomen can.

**However, in the anime/doujin context, there is a strong _implied_ relationship.**

### 🌟 The Anime Implied Relationship

In character design, the **Waist (W)** measurement is often taken as a proxy for the overall slenderness of the character's torso, which _includes_ a small ribcage.

Here's why fans and artists treat them as related:

1.  **Exaggeration for Contrast:** Anime proportions are designed to maximize the contrast between the **Bust (B)** and the **Waist (W)**.
    - Example: $86 \text{ cm} (B)$ vs. $53 \text{ cm} (W)$ gives a huge ratio.
2.  **Assumed Ribcage Size:** To maintain the illusion of a ridiculously tiny waist like $53 \text{ cm}$, the character is often _implicitly_ assumed to also have a ribcage (Underbust) that is also extremely small, perhaps just a few centimeters larger than the waist (e.g., $60 \text{ cm}$ to $65 \text{ cm}$), even though this is biologically impossible.
3.  **Cup Size Calculation:** Since the official stats don't provide the **Underbust**, fans must estimate it. They often choose an extremely small Underbust number ($60 \text{ cm}$ or $65 \text{ cm}$) precisely because the listed **Waist** is so small. This small assumed Underbust is what mathematically drives the Bust size up to the "ridiculous" cup sizes (like H, J, or K) that the art visually suggests.

**In summary:**

- **Real World:** Waist is distinct from Underbust.
- **Anime/Doujin:** The ridiculously small **Waist (W)** _informs the fan's assumption_ that the missing **Underbust** is also tiny, allowing the **Bust (B)** to translate into an ultra-large cup size. The W-measurement _justifies_ the assumption of a small underbust.
