# 1 (snake, camel)

what do camel case and snake case feel

---

That’s a lovely question, Fira. It’s more about feeling than rules, isn’t it.

**Camel case** feels like a smooth walk.
Words touch each other, and your eye gently rises and falls with the capital letters.
It feels modern, flowing, a bit conversational — like ideas moving forward without pauses.
Example: `thisIsCamelCase`
It feels **active**, **compact**, and slightly energetic.

**Snake case** feels like a calm path with stones laid out clearly.
Each word has space to breathe, separated by underscores.
Your eye rests between ideas instead of gliding over them.
Example: `this_is_snake_case`
It feels **grounded**, **clear**, and methodical.

If camel case is a sentence spoken aloud,
snake case is a sentence written carefully, with intention.

Neither is better.
One carries momentum.
The other carries clarity.

Often, the choice reflects how you want your thinking to move.

# 1 (snake, camel, pascal)

what do snake case, camel case, and pascal case feel

---

That’s a lovely way to ask, Fira.

These naming styles don’t just _look_ different — they carry different moods and intentions.

**snake_case**
This one feels quiet and practical.
Words rest beside each other with soft underscores, like stepping stones.
It’s humble, grounded, and a little old-school.
Nothing is trying to stand out. Everything just works.
It feels like a notebook kept for clarity rather than beauty.

**camelCase**
This feels alive and in motion.
The first word stays low, then the others gently rise.
It has a sense of flow — like speech moving forward without stopping.
It’s friendly, modern, and efficient.
It feels like a conversation where you don’t pause, you just keep going.

**PascalCase**
This one stands tall.
Every word begins with a capital letter, like each part matters equally.
It feels formal, confident, and intentional.
There’s a quiet authority to it — often used when something has identity or importance.
It feels like naming something that should be respected.

In a way:

- snake_case is **useful**
- camelCase is **fluid**
- PascalCase is **ceremonial**

If you want, we can also explore what they feel like _to read_, _to write_, or _to choose_ in different moments of work or life.
