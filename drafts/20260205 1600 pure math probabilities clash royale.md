Understood, Fira.
I’ll be quiet and wait.

1v1 game. either win or loss. 12 wins or 3 losses. how is a player achieving 12 wins.

---

Alright, Fira.

In this kind of 1v1 run, the rule is simple: the run **ends** when one of two things happens
– the player reaches **12 wins**, or
– the player reaches **3 losses**.

So a player achieves **12 wins** by winning **12 matches before they lose 3 times**.

That’s the whole condition.

A few clarifying points that matter:

- The wins do **not** have to be in a row.
  A player could go 12–0, 12–1, or 12–2.
  The moment the third loss happens, the run is over and 12 is no longer reachable.

- Mathematically, this strongly favors players who win **most** of their games.
  If someone’s chance to win a single match is low or even average, they will usually hit 3 losses long before 12 wins.

To make it concrete:

- A very strong player (say ~80–90% win rate) will often reach 12 wins.
- A balanced player (~50% win rate) almost never will.
- A weaker player will usually end the run quickly.

So achieving 12 wins isn’t about luck over a few games.
It’s a test of **consistency under pressure**—winning far more often than losing, again and again, before mistakes pile up.

# 2

if there are a lot of players, how much players could achieve 12 wins

---

Fira, this depends on **how strong the players are**, not just how many there are.

The quiet truth is this:
**12 wins is rare by design.** The system is meant to filter most players out.

Let me give you a clean way to see it.

### The key factor: win rate

Each player has some chance to win a single 1v1 match.
Call it **p**.

- If p is low, they almost always hit 3 losses first.
- If p is high, they have a real shot at 12 wins.

There’s a sharp cutoff.

Rough intuition:

- **~50% win rate**
  Almost **no one** reaches 12 wins. Even with thousands of players, the number is close to zero.

- **~60% win rate**
  A **tiny fraction** succeed. Think _a few out of hundreds_.

- **~70% win rate**
  Now it becomes noticeable. Roughly **5–10%** of these players can reach 12 wins.

- **~80%+ win rate**
  A **large portion** succeed. This is elite territory.

### What happens when there are “a lot” of players

If the player pool is large:

- Most players cluster around average skill.
- Those players are statistically doomed to hit 3 losses early.
- Only the **right tail** of the skill distribution—the consistently strong players—make it through.

So even with:

- 10,000 players
  you might see:
- a few dozen
- maybe a couple hundred at most

reach 12 wins, **unless** the pool is unusually strong.

### The deeper insight

The system doesn’t measure participation.
It measures **separation**.

12 wins isn’t something “many” players achieve.
It’s something the system allows **only when skill overwhelms variance**.

That’s why it feels prestigious—and why most runs quietly end at 3 losses.

# 3

the p is not fixed. it depends on the matchup. and your opponent will get stonger as you go further. i mean you could only play a game with the opponent of the same wins.

---

I see what you’re pointing at, Fira.
This changes the picture in an important way.

When matchmaking is **by the same number of wins**, the game is no longer “you versus randomness”.
It becomes **you climbing a narrowing ladder**.

Here’s the clean way to think about it.

### What same-wins matchmaking really does

At 0 wins, you face almost anyone.
At 5 wins, you face people who already won 5 times.
At 10 wins, you face only people who survived where most others failed.

So even if a player is genuinely strong, their **effective win chance shrinks** as they go higher, because:

- Weak players are already gone
- Average players are thinning out
- You’re mostly fighting people very close to your own level

Skill advantage gets compressed.

### The funnel effect

Imagine 1,000 players starting.

After each win tier:

- Many players drop out by hitting 3 losses
- Fewer players remain to even _attempt_ the next win

By the time you reach:

- 6–7 wins → the pool is already small
- 9–10 wins → the pool is tiny
- 11 wins → you’re fighting the survivors of survivors

This creates a **funnel**, not a ladder.

### What that means for 12 wins

Even with a large population:

- Most players never reach high tiers
- Most strong players still fail eventually
- Only players who are:

  - consistently better _and_
  - perform well under escalating pressure
    make it through

In practice, with same-wins matchmaking:

- Out of **1,000 players**, you might see **5–20** reach 12 wins
- Out of **10,000 players**, maybe **50–200**
- The exact number depends on how wide the skill distribution is, but it is always a **small percentage**

Not because the players are bad.
Because the structure is intentionally unforgiving.

### The quiet insight

This system doesn’t reward “being good”.
It rewards **being good relative to everyone else who is still alive at that exact moment**.

At the top, it’s no longer about climbing.
It’s about **not slipping**, even once too many times, while facing mirrors of yourself.

That’s why 12 wins feels almost mythical — even in a crowded room.

# 4

at the first a few games you will often see stupid opponents with generally weak decks. going further, you will see strong decks. some of the strong decks are stable. often close wins. you can have a high win rate with stable decks but you must be careful. some of the strong decks are no skill. easy wins or sometimes no chance to win. if you are facing an obvious counter, you could not win by yourself. instead you have to leverage your opponent's mistakes, by playing a lot of cards with unexpected random behavior at the same time for example. but sometimes your opponent could solve with ease. how does it impact. how much, what kind of players could get 12 wins.

---

Fira, you’re describing the reality of these modes very accurately.
Once we include **deck archetypes, counters, and randomness**, the picture becomes clearer—and harsher.

Let’s slow it down.

---

### How this environment really behaves

Early games are noise.
Weak decks, bad sequencing, free wins. Almost anyone competent passes.

The real game starts around **6–7 wins**.

From there:

- **Deck strength converges**
  Bad decks are gone. Only “real” decks remain.
- **Matchups matter more than skill**
  Some games are close, some are nearly unwinnable.
- **Player agency shrinks**
  Even good decisions sometimes can’t overcome structure.

So the question stops being _“How good are you?”_
It becomes _“How often does the system allow you to express skill?”_

---

### Stable decks vs. no-skill decks

**Stable decks**

- High floor, moderate ceiling
- Win by small edges
- Lose slowly
- Require discipline and precision

These decks give you:

- A **higher average win rate**
- Fewer instant losses
- But many **knife-edge games** where one slip ends the run

They reward calm, consistent players—but punish fatigue.

**No-skill / polar decks**

- Either crush or get crushed
- Matchup-dependent
- Often trivial to pilot

These decks:

- Create **hard walls** you cannot outplay
- Create **free wins** you don’t deserve
- Inject volatility into the system

They don’t lower the average skill level.
They **increase variance**.

---

### The role of randomness and baiting mistakes

When you face a hard counter, true agency drops to near zero.
Your only path is:

- Forcing **decision overload**
- Creating **unexpected states**
- Hoping for a **timing or sequencing error**

This isn’t “playing better”.
It’s **buying lottery tickets** with clever chaos.

Sometimes it works.
Sometimes your opponent is simply solid, and the door stays closed.

---

### How this impacts 12 wins

This environment filters players into **three real categories**.

#### 1. Strong but clean players

- Excellent fundamentals
- Prefer stable decks
- Low tolerance for chaos

They often reach **8–10 wins**, then die to:

- A single counter
- One fatigue error
- One mentally draining close game

They are good—but the system asks for more than goodness.

#### 2. High-skill chaos navigators

- Strong fundamentals **and**
- Comfort with randomness
- Willingly increase variance when behind
- Emotionally detached from outcomes

These players understand:

> “When control is gone, don’t fight it—shape it.”

They are the **most likely** to reach 12 wins.

#### 3. Structural abusers

- Play decks that are:

  - Overtuned
  - Polar
  - Meta-exploiting

- Skill ceiling is low, but path is narrow

They can reach 12 wins **only when**:

- Matchups align
- They avoid mirrors
- Variance favors them

When they do, it looks easy.
When they don’t, it looks hopeless.

---

### So who actually gets 12 wins?

In this system, 12 wins is achieved by players who have:

- Solid fundamentals (non-negotiable)
- Meta awareness (what they can and cannot beat)
- Emotional stability across close games
- Willingness to **switch modes**:

  - Precision when ahead
  - Controlled chaos when behind

- Acceptance that some games are unwinnable—and not tilting because of it

Not the “best” players in theory.
The **most adaptable** ones in practice.

---

### The final quiet truth

12 wins isn’t a reward for mastery alone.
It’s a reward for **surviving variance without losing yourself**.

Many skilled players are filtered out not by bad play—
but by matchups, fatigue, and the moment they try to force control where none exists.

The players who make it through understand one thing deeply:

> You don’t beat the system.
> You move with it, just enough, until it lets you pass.

# 5

what if it's 20 wins or 3 losses.

---

Fira, moving the bar from **12 wins** to **20 wins** doesn’t just make the run longer.
It **changes who the system is even capable of rewarding**.

Let’s be precise and calm about it.

---

### What changes structurally

With same-wins matchmaking and **only 3 losses allowed**, each additional required win:

- Narrows the funnel further
- Increases exposure to hard counters
- Increases fatigue and error probability
- Makes variance dominant over time

At 12 wins, you are already deep in survivor territory.
At 20 wins, you are asking someone to survive **twice as long** under rising pressure, with no extra margin for error.

That is not linear difficulty.
It’s exponential attrition.

---

### Skill stops scaling the way you expect

Early and mid stages still reward skill.
Late stages don’t.

By ~10–12 wins:

- Almost everyone left is strong
- Deck power is converged
- Win rates compress toward 50%

Beyond that:

- Matchups matter more than decisions
- One bad pairing can erase an hour of perfect play
- Even elite players are coin-flipping repeatedly

Skill can’t protect you indefinitely against:

- Polar decks
- Random outcomes
- Mirror matches under fatigue

---

### What kind of player could reach 20 wins?

The group shrinks dramatically.

#### Consistently elite + variance-tolerant

- Top fraction of the player base
- Deep matchup knowledge
- Comfortable playing “ugly” when needed
- Emotionally immune to streaks

Even for them, success is **rare**, not reliable.

#### Meta exploiters during narrow windows

- When the format is temporarily broken
- One deck suppresses most counters
- Player pool hasn’t adapted yet

In those moments, 20 wins becomes possible—but only briefly.

---

### Who is effectively locked out

- Clean, methodical players
- Control-style perfectionists
- Anyone relying on small edges over time

Not because they’re weak—
but because **time + variance beats discipline** eventually.

---

### What the numbers feel like in reality

With a large population:

- **12 wins** → small but visible group succeeds
- **20 wins** → success becomes _exceptional_

Out of:

- 10,000 strong players

  - 12 wins: maybe dozens to low hundreds
  - 20 wins: **single digits**, sometimes zero in a cycle

Some days, **no one** makes it.

---

### The deeper truth

A 20-win, 3-loss system is no longer testing mastery.

It’s testing:

- Who can endure variance the longest
- Who avoids the worst counters by chance
- Who stays sharp while others slip

At that point, the achievement says less about “being the best”
and more about **being the one the system didn’t crush that day**.

---

### Quiet conclusion

12 wins filters for excellence.
20 wins filters for **near-impossible alignment**.

When a system demands perfection across too many trials with no margin,
it stops crowning skill—and starts crowning survivors of randomness.

And that changes everything about who makes it to the end.

# 6

what if it's 5 losses out and you can keep going if you can find a match

---

Fira, this one change—**5 losses instead of 3, and no hard stop on wins**—softens the system in a very specific, meaningful way.

It doesn’t make the game easy.
It makes it **honest**.

---

### What the extra losses really do

Those two extra losses don’t just add forgiveness.
They **restore player agency**.

With 3 losses:

- One bad counter can end a perfect run
- Variance dominates late stages
- Mental pressure is extreme

With 5 losses:

- A hard counter hurts, but doesn’t end everything
- You’re allowed to “pay” for bad matchups
- Skill has time to reassert itself

The game shifts from _survival_ to _endurance_.

---

### Same-wins matchmaking still matters

Opponents still get stronger as wins increase.
The funnel still narrows.

But now:

- Players can absorb bad luck
- Close losses aren’t fatal
- Fatigue errors aren’t instantly terminal

This stretches the curve instead of snapping it.

---

### Who can keep going far

#### Consistent, disciplined players

These players benefit the most.

- Stable decks shine
- Small edges accumulate
- Clean play over many games matters again

They may lose to counters, but they don’t spiral.

#### Adaptive players

- Know when to play tight
- Know when to inject chaos
- Recover well after losses

They turn losses into information, not tilt.

#### Polar-deck players

They still exist, but:

- Their bad matchups stack up over time
- Five losses exposes their fragility
- They flame out eventually

Variance no longer protects them for long.

---

### What “no win cap” actually means

If matches are available:

- The ceiling is no longer artificial
- The limiting factors become:

  - Mental stamina
  - Meta positioning
  - Deck robustness
  - Time

Some players will:

- Plateau
- Drift around a win band
- Slowly climb as weaker players drop out

A few will go **very far**.

---

### How many could do it?

In a large pool:

- Many more players reach double-digit wins
- Fewer runs end early for unfair reasons
- The distribution spreads out instead of collapsing

You’d see:

- A long tail of strong players
- Clear separation by consistency, not luck

Not everyone climbs high—but **the ones who do deserve it**.

---

### The quiet takeaway

This format doesn’t ask:

> “Can you survive perfection?”

It asks:

> “Can you play well for a long time?”

That’s a better question.

Not kinder—
just more aligned with what skill actually looks like in a messy, matchup-driven game.

# 7

what if everyone can create a new game when losing or have many accounts. does it change much.

---

Fira, this changes **almost nothing about who can go far**—but it changes **how we interpret success**.

Let’s separate the two.

---

### What does _not_ change

The structure of each run is unchanged.

- Same-wins matchmaking still funnels players
- Strong opponents still appear as wins increase
- Counters, variance, and fatigue still exist
- Five losses still cap how much bad luck you can absorb

No matter how many accounts someone has, **each run lives or dies on its own**.

A weak player doesn’t become strong by resetting.
A polar deck doesn’t stop being fragile.
Variance still extracts its price.

So the **ceiling of performance** stays the same.

---

### What _does_ change

What changes is **sampling**.

Having many accounts or infinite retries means:

- More attempts at favorable variance
- More chances to dodge bad matchups
- More opportunities for one “clean” run

This doesn’t raise _average_ performance.
It raises the chance of a **statistical outlier**.

In other words:

> Skill determines how high you _can_ go.
> Attempts determine how often you _get to show it_.

---

### Who benefits from multiple accounts

#### High-skill, high-consistency players

They benefit the most.

- Their failure rate is already low
- Extra attempts mainly remove bad luck
- Eventually, variance lines up

These players don’t get stronger—but their **true level becomes visible** more often.

#### Polar-deck players

They benefit in a noisy way.

- Most runs die early
- Occasionally everything aligns
- Those rare runs look impressive but aren’t repeatable

They create **false signals**.

#### Average players

Almost no benefit.

- They fail for structural reasons
- Resetting just repeats the same ceiling
- Their best runs don’t improve meaningfully

---

### How it changes the leaderboard feeling

With unlimited resets:

- You see **more extreme results**
- High win counts become less rare
- But also less informative

A single deep run no longer proves mastery.
**Repeated deep runs** still do.

The signal shifts from:

> “Did you ever do it?”

to:

> “How often do you do it?”

---

### The deeper consequence

This system stops rewarding **restraint** and starts rewarding **time and persistence**.

Not in a shallow way—
but in a probabilistic one.

Someone who plays perfectly but only once
will be outshined by someone slightly worse who plays a hundred times.

That’s not unfair.
It’s just statistics.

---

### Quiet conclusion

Multiple accounts don’t break the system.
They blur the meaning of individual success.

Skill still decides **how far a run can go**.
Retries decide **how often luck lets you reach that distance**.

So the real measure shifts:

Not the tallest spike—
but the shape of the mountain beneath it.
