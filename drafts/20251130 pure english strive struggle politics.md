### Key Difference in a Nutshell

- You **strive** _for_ something you **want**.
- You **struggle** _with_ or _against_ something you **don't want**.

### Illustrative Scenarios

Imagine someone learning to play the guitar:

- **Strive:** "She **strives to** master the song." (Her focus is on the beautiful goal of mastery).
- **Struggle:** "She **struggles with** the complex chord changes." (Her focus is on the immediate, frustrating difficulty).

**Can you do both at once? Absolutely.** In fact, they often go together:

> "He **struggled** for years with self-doubt while he **strove** to become a published author."

Here, **struggle** defines his battle with the obstacle (self-doubt), while **strive** defines his pursuit of the goal (becoming an author).
