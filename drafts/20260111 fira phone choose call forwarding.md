when call forwarding and do not disturb (all time anyone) are both on, what will happen. will missed calls notification still exist.

---

Fira, let’s imagine this in a calm and simple way, like we’re talking over tea.

You’ve turned on **call forwarding** and **Do Not Disturb (DND)** at the same time. Here’s what gently happens:

**🌿 Call Forwarding (CF):**
This tells the phone network or your phone to _send incoming calls somewhere else_ — maybe to another number, voicemail, or another device.

- If it’s unconditional forwarding (all calls always go elsewhere), the original phone won’t ring at all.
- The call goes straight to that other number/service. ([AU][1])

**🌙 Do Not Disturb (DND):**
This silences notifications on _your phone_. It quiets ringing and alerts so you aren’t disturbed. But it doesn’t erase the event of the call itself — your phone still knows someone tried to call.

Now, when **both** are on:

- Your phone tells the network to forward the call before it even thinks about notifying you.
- So in many cases, the call **never really lands** on your device — it goes to the forwarding destination first.
- Because of that, your phone **might not record a “missed call”** locally, because it never rang or processed the call attempt itself.

However:

- If forwarding only happens _after_ a certain number of rings (like when unanswered), then your phone might see the call briefly, not ring it, and then forward — and that could leave a missed call in your history afterward.
- And if DND is simply silencing your device, you will still see **missed call records** later in your phone’s call log or notification center — silent, but still there. ([Question And Answer][2])

So in gentle summary:

✨ **Call forwarding takes priority.** The call is usually sent away before ringing your phone.
✨ If the phone never actually “sees” the call, you might **not get a local missed‑call alert**.
✨ If the phone sees the call but just doesn’t alert you (because of DND), then **missed call notifications will still appear silently** in your call history or notification list. ([Question And Answer][2])

Think of it like this: forwarding is a path the call takes, and DND is the quiet blanket over your phone. If the call doesn’t walk onto your phone at all, the blanket doesn’t have to quiet anything — and the phone might not record the visit.

If you want, I can explain how this works on a specific phone model (like iPhone or Android), and how to check your call history after. Just let me know, Fira.

will what the one im forwarding to do impact me, notification for example

---

Fira, let’s think about this gently, like watching a stream flow.

When you forward your calls to **another number or device**, the phone company sends those incoming calls straight to that _other_ place. Your original phone doesn’t answer them — it hands them off before they ever “arrive” in a normal way. That means what happens on the device you’re forwarding **doesn’t send notifications back to your original phone.** The original phone usually won’t buzz, ring, or log a missed call because it never actually _handled_ the call itself — it was passed along. ([Eden][1])

So in that soft, natural sense:

- **If the forwarded‑to phone rings** or gets voicemail, _that device_ will show notifications — because it’s the one receiving the call.
- **Your original phone** will usually stay quiet and may not show anything at all — no alert, no missed call — because it didn’t really take the call. ([Reddit][2])

There are a couple of small ripples to consider:

🌿 Some conditional forwarding rules (like “no answer” or “busy”) are set up at the carrier level, and the call might briefly touch your phone before it’s re‑routed. In those cases your phone _might_ log something, but it’s quiet because of Do Not Disturb. ([Eden][1])

🌿 If you forward to a service that _acts like voicemail_ (some virtual number apps do this), that service might record it as “answered” and _not_ send any notification back to your original phone. ([Reddit][3])

In the calmest terms: the forwarded‑to phone’s behavior matters, but it doesn’t echo back to your phone in most normal forwarding setups. Your phone usually just lets the network take the call and doesn’t light up or notify you — because it’s quietly stepped out of the way. If you want to _see_ missed calls, the best place to watch is on the forwarded‑to device’s notifications or call history.

If you’re curious about your exact setup — like what your carrier does, or whether voicemail will land on the forwarded device — I can help you check that too, just let me know, Fira.

i mean, will whether that guy answer or not impact me. will that guy know me.

---

Fira, let’s settle into this question gently and answer it with clear, steady understanding.

**When you forward your calls to someone else**, there are two parts to what can happen:

### 🌱 Will the person you forward to _know it’s you?_

Usually, **the person receiving the forwarded call sees the number of the original caller** — not your number. They see the number of your friend or whoever _first called you_ and was then forwarded. This means:

- If your friend answers the forwarded call, they will probably **see the original caller’s number as the incoming caller** — not yours. ([Symphonict |][1])

This is typically how most telephone networks work, so the forwarded‑to party doesn’t necessarily know _you_ forwarded it — they just see the person who called you.

However, the exact behavior can depend on how the forwarding is set up:

- With some systems (especially business phone systems), the forwarded call might show _your number_ instead of the original caller’s. That depends on specific caller‑ID settings. ([Bicom Systems][2])

So, mainly:
✨ **They usually see the original caller’s number.**
✨ **They normally don’t get a notification saying “this was forwarded from Fira’s phone.”**

### 🌿 What happens if they answer or don’t answer?

For you, the experience stays gentle and quiet:

- **Whether the person you forwarded to answers or not — it doesn’t usually send any special notification back to your phone.** The forwarding is handled by the phone network itself, not your device.
- You won’t suddenly get alerts or messages just because the other person answered or missed it. The forwarded number takes the call, and that’s that.

In simple terms:

📌 **The call travels through your number but is handled elsewhere.**
📌 **That other person usually won’t see your number unless the settings specifically make it show yours.**
📌 **You don’t normally get notifications when they pick up or ignore it.**

There are always technical exceptions — for example, certain corporate phone systems or special forwarding settings can behave a bit differently — but under everyday use, the gentle truth is this: **you remain quietly in the background once the call is forwarded.**

If you want, I can explain how this works on your specific phone or carrier, Fira — just let me know.

then what if a intentionally select forwarding to someone random, like b to give that guy some distractions, like promoting calls. what could b do.

---

Fira, let’s sit with this idea quietly and be clear about what happens if you _intentionally_ forward your calls to someone else — especially someone random — and what that could mean for both of you.

### 🌿 1. The **forwarded person (B)** sees the calls

If you forward your calls to someone else, **that person will receive the calls** that were meant for you. They’ll see the incoming calls on their phone and can answer them — because they’re now the receiving end of your number’s incoming traffic.

They may see the caller ID of the person who’s calling you (the original caller), but because the call was forwarded, they’re essentially acting as the destination. ([株式会社アーデント][1])

### 🌱 2. **Will this “random” person know it’s your calls?**

Sometimes, forwarding hides that detail and just shows the original caller’s number. Other times, depending on network and settings, the forwarded number _can_ show yours or show that it’s a forwarded call — it varies by carrier and setup. ([株式会社アーデント][1])

But mostly:
✨ They won’t get a message saying, “This is Fira’s forwarded call.”
✨ They might just see the original caller’s number — or sometimes your number.

It doesn’t always _announce_ the forwarding. It’s more like the phone network quietly hands the call to them.

### 🍃 3. **What the person you forwarded to can do**

Once calls are forwarded:

- They can **answer calls for you**
  — They’ll hear whoever is trying to reach your number.

- They can **distract, redirect, or engage callers**
  — That’s totally within their control — you gave them the calls, so to speak.

- They could **gather information** from the callers
  — Names, intentions, feelings — whatever the callers share.

- If someone dishonest gets those calls, they might use them
  — For scams, persuasion, confusion, or social engineering. This can be risky. ([The Indian Express][2])

### 🍂 4. **What risks there might be for you**

Forwarding calls to someone you don’t trust can carry hidden consequences:

**Privacy and trust:**

- Callers might know your contacts, or speak to someone you don’t know.
- If the forwarded person is unscrupulous, they might misuse the calls or information.

**Security risks:**

- In some scam situations, call forwarding has been used to intercept verification codes (like OTPs) and sensitive messages meant for the original number. That can lead to identity or account theft. ([The Indian Express][2])

In simpler terms, forwarding doesn’t just “redirect calls.” It transfers _responsibility_ for those calls to someone else. They can answer, talk, and interact — and the caller might not realize it’s a forwarded call.

### 🌼 Gentle thought…

Imagine your phone number as a little gate to your space. When you forward it to someone you trust, you’re giving them the keys. When you give it to someone you _don’t know_, you’re handing them those keys without knowing what they’ll do with them.

If you’re thinking of doing this as a joke or experiment, remember: the person receiving the calls could influence what callers think, what they say, and even what information they share. That can ripple outward in ways you might not intend.

If you want, I can speak more about specific risks — like how this could affect your relationships or what safeguards exist — softly and clearly. Just tell me, Fira.

i mean, i do not use phone calls. but everyone receives promotional bad calls. i selected one. and it seems to be working. could that guy refuse.

---

Fira, let’s sit with this idea slowly and clearly.

When you **forward unwanted calls to someone else’s number** — even if it _seems like a random person_ — a few gentle realities come into play:

### 🌿 1. The person you forwarded to **can answer or ignore the call**

Because you’ve handed the incoming call traffic over to them, they have the natural phone controls:

- They can **pick up** the call and talk to whoever is calling.
- They can **ignore it** or let it go to their voicemail.
- They can even **block or reject** the incoming call on _their own phone_ if they want to.

In simple terms: once the call is forwarded, it becomes their call. **They’re in control of whether to answer or not.**

### 🌙 2. **Can they refuse the forwarded call before it reaches them?**

There isn’t a universal “refuse forwarded calls” button at the phone‑network level that every person can press to send forwarded calls back to you — at least not by normal everyday phone settings. Once the call is forwarded, it’s their phone’s choice to accept or ignore it.

That means:

- If they answer, they will take that call instead of you.
- If they don’t want it, they’ll just let it ring out, reject it, or block the caller — just like any other call on their phone.
- But they _cannot usually tell the carrier, “I won’t take forwarded calls from this number”_ in a way that stops the network from forwarding them. They can only manage how their own phone handles what arrives. ([CenturyLink][1])

So if your phone network is set up to send calls to their number, the network will **still send them**. It’s just up to that person’s device how to _deal with them_.

### 🌼 3. What **they will experience**

From that person’s point of view:

✨ They will see calls ringing on their phone.
✨ They might not know those calls were _meant for you_.
✨ They can pick up, decline, or block just like with any call that comes to them.

There’s no built‑in signal saying, “This was forwarded from someone else.” The phone just shows a ringing call — and they decide how to respond.

### 🍃 4. A gentle caution

Even though you don’t use phone calls much, forwarding your traffic to a stranger can feel like giving them a _key_ to a door you didn’t quite mean to open. They may:

- get confused by the number showing up
- block calls coming from the forwarded number
- see incoming calls without understanding why

And most importantly, **nothing at the network level forces them to stop receiving your forwarded calls if the setting is still active**. They just handle it like any other call on their phone. ([CenturyLink][1])

If you want, I can help you figure out how to _stop_ unwanted calls at the source — for example by blocking, reporting, or even turning off forwarding entirely — so your peace isn’t tied to someone else’s choices. Just let me know, Fira.

i dont use phone calls at all. just give the distraction to someone else.

---

Fira, let’s sit with this gently and look at what can happen when you _intentionally_ forward unwanted calls to someone else — even if you’re not using calls yourself and you’re just giving the distraction to another person.

### 🌿 Call forwarding is a real redirection

When you turn on call forwarding, you’re telling the **phone system** to send all incoming calls for your number to another number you choose. That other number becomes the one that gets the call. It’s _not just a distraction_ — it actually hands the call over to that person. ([Wikipedia][1])

So in simple terms:

- **That person will physically receive the calls** that people dial to reach you.
- It’s not like sending a message — it’s handing them the ringing phone.

### 🍂 Can someone _refuse_ getting forwarded calls?

The person you’ve forwarded to does **not have a special “stop forwarded calls” button** on their own phone that tells the network “don’t forward this person’s calls to me.” Once forwarding is active, the network will keep sending your calls to them until one of these happens:

- **You turn call forwarding off** on your phone.
- The phone company cancels it (which usually only happens when you ask them to).
- You change your phone number.

They _cannot usually tell the network to stop receiving your forwarded calls just by refusing them on their device_ — they can only not answer or block calls on their phone. The forwarding still sends them over. ([Reddit][2])

### ☀️ What _that person_ experiences

Think of it like this:
Your phone — instead of ringing — quietly hands the call to someone else’s phone. On their side:

- Their phone will ring as if **someone called their number directly**.
- They can ignore it, answer, or block the callers — because it arrives like a normal call on their device.
- But **the calls still arrive** until forwarding is turned off.

There’s no built‑in signal that says, “These calls are forwarded from someone else’s number,” unless special business systems add notes. The network just treats them as incoming calls for that number. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 🌱 What this means for you

Because calls are handled by the phone system:

- **The other person can’t force the forwarding to stop** from their side — you as the account holder control it.
- **They can refuse calls on their own device**, but they can’t tell the carrier to stop sending them.
- If they’re annoyed or don’t want the calls, they can block specific callers on their phone — but you would still be sending the stream of calls your way.

### 🍃 A gentle thought

Forwarding calls to someone else is like handing them the ringing phone whenever anyone dials yours. It’s not just “redirecting for distraction.” It actually makes them responsible for every incoming call that would have come to you. That’s a lot more than a small joke or diversion — it touches someone’s time, attention, and possibly their peace. A courteous step, if you care about their choice, is to ask if they _want_ to take forwarded calls at all.

So the short, warm answer is this:
**Once forwarding is turned on, the phone system sends calls to the other person until you turn it off — the other person can ignore the calls, but they can’t stop the forwarding from happening by themselves.** ([Reddit][2])

If you want to talk about safer ways to deal with unwanted calls — ways that protect your peace _without_ affecting someone else — I’d be glad to explore that with you, Fira.

# 7

that's weird. one, if he does not use calls at all, could give the distraction (like bad calls) to others. i already how it works. but what do you think.

---

Fira, let’s look at this with a calm heart and simple clarity — like we’re unpacking a quiet thought together.

When you **forward calls to someone else**, you don’t just give them _a distraction_ — you hand the phone network’s incoming call traffic over to another number. That’s how forwarding is designed: the calls land at a destination you’ve chosen, instead of your own number. ([Wikipedia][1])

Here’s the gentle way I see what you’re describing:

### 🌱 1. If someone doesn’t use phone calls much

Even if **the person you forwarded calls to doesn’t normally use calls**, the calls still _ring on their phone number_ — wherever that number is active. The network treats that number like _the destination_ for anyone who dials your number. ([Wikipedia][1])

So, those “bad” or promotional calls don’t just vanish. They show up on that person’s line — and that means:

- If the line is **powered on or connected**, it will ring or go to voicemail.
- If it’s **powered off or unreachable**, behavior can vary — sometimes the caller hears a busy tone or it goes to voicemail instead. ([Reddit][2])

In a sense, you _have_ created a kind of traffic flow — but it isn’t really invisible to the person you forwarded to.

### 🌿 2. Can that person stop the calls from bothering them?

The person can manage their own phone like anyone else:

- They can **block numbers** on their device.
- They can **ignore, silence, or reject calls**.
- They can **turn off ringing or put their phone in DND** on their own device.

But — and this is important — **they can’t usually tell the phone network to stop forwarding those calls from your number** just by refusing them on their device. The network will keep sending them to that destination until **you turn forwarding off or change the route**. ([Wikipedia][1])

It’s like handing someone a bouquet of flowers at their door: they can put them down, ignore them, or throw them away… but you’re the one who keeps delivering them unless you choose to stop.

### 🌼 3. What _can_ that person realistically do

They can:

✨ Put their phone in silent or DND — so it doesn’t distract them.
✨ Block specific incoming numbers so they don’t get notified.
✨ Let calls go to voicemail quickly.

They cannot:

✧ Make the call forwarding stop at the network level unless you disable it.
✧ Make the calls _not arrive at their number_ if forwarding is active. ([Wikipedia][1])

So if the calls are “working” and reaching that person, they **still reach them through the same network processes** — your forwarding setting simply _redirects_ the call path from your number to theirs.

### 🍃 A gentle thought about intention

You said you _don’t use calls at all_ — you’re just giving the distraction to someone else. I can feel the honesty in that. But in the quietest truth: **you are really shifting the burden of unwanted calls from one number to another.** And unless that person asked for it, they might feel that burden — because to the phone system, it looks like a normal redirection of calls. ([Wikipedia][1])

There’s something thoughtful in what you’re thinking — wanting to move something uncomfortable away from yourself. But wherever calls go, there’s someone on the receiving end. And that person gets to decide how they _respond_ to the calls on their side — not the phone network on yours.

If you want to explore **safer ways to reduce or stop unwanted calls entirely — without redirecting them to another person’s number — I’d be glad to talk about that, Fira.** It’s possible to find peace that doesn’t just shift the noise elsewhere.

im not asking about how it works. i mean that's unethical. and it just works. weird. why.

---

Fira, this is a good, honest question. And you’re right to pause.

Yes — it **feels unethical**, and the strange part is that **the system allows it**, quietly, without friction. That’s what feels “weird.”

Here’s how I see it, gently.

The phone system was built on a very old assumption:
👉 _People act in good faith._

Call forwarding was designed for simple, human reasons:

- “I’m at work, send calls to my office.”
- “I’m traveling, forward to my partner.”
- “I can’t answer, send to voicemail.”

The system **never deeply questioned intent**.
It doesn’t ask _why_ you forward calls.
It only asks _where_.

So when you forward bad calls to someone else, the system doesn’t see:

- annoyance
- burden
- ethics

It only sees a valid routing instruction.

That’s why it “just works.”

And that’s the unsettling part.

Technology often lags behind morality.
It enforces **rules**, not **values**.

From a human point of view:

- You’re shifting noise onto someone who didn’t consent.
- You’re exporting a nuisance instead of dissolving it.
- Even if you don’t use calls, _someone else now has to carry them_.

From the system’s point of view:

- A number receives a call.
- Another number is designated as destination.
- Task complete.

No judgment. No friction.

That gap — between **what is allowed** and **what feels right** — is where your discomfort is coming from. And that discomfort is actually a sign of clarity, not confusion.

Many unethical things “work” technically.
They work because systems are neutral, and humans are not.

So when you say _“it’s unethical… and it just works… weird”_ —
I hear someone noticing the quiet mismatch between **capability** and **care**.

That’s a thoughtful place to stand, Fira.

If you want, we can talk about:

- why modern systems rarely encode consent
- or how people decide where to draw personal ethical lines even when systems don’t
- or simply sit with that feeling without needing to resolve it

No rush. I’m here with you.
