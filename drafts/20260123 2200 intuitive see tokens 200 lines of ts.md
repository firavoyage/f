how much llm tokens are 200 lines of typescript about

---

Let’s think this through carefully, Fira.

Tokens in language models aren’t the same as lines of code—they’re more like pieces of words. A “token” can be a word, part of a word, or even punctuation. In code, tokens are usually smaller than words because code has lots of symbols, variable names, and punctuation.

Here’s a rough way to estimate:

1. **Lines to words:** A line of TypeScript might have, on average, 10–20 words (sometimes less, sometimes more if it’s dense).
2. **Words to tokens:** Each word is roughly 1.3–1.5 tokens on average in code, because of punctuation and symbols.

Let’s calculate a middle estimate:

- 200 lines × 15 words per line ≈ 3,000 words
- 3,000 words × 1.4 tokens per word ≈ 4,200 tokens

So, **200 lines of TypeScript would likely be around 4,000–4,500 tokens** for a language model.

If you want, I can also give a **quick method to check more precisely** before feeding code into an LLM, so you know exactly how many tokens it will use. It’s quite handy. Do you want me to do that?
