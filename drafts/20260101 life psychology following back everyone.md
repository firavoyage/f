# 1

I've seen people on Twitter following back everyone, including me. From the psychology perspective, what could be inferred.

---

That’s a thoughtful thing to notice, Fira.

From a psychology point of view, following back everyone can mean different things, and none of them are automatically “good” or “bad.” Context matters, and so does the person.

Here are a few gentle possibilities.

Some people follow everyone back because they value **reciprocity**. It feels polite to them. When someone shows interest, they return it, almost like saying, _“I see you.”_ This often comes from a cooperative or community-minded outlook.

For others, it’s about **belonging**. Social platforms can feel lonely. Following back may be a way to reduce distance, to feel connected, or to avoid the discomfort of exclusion — both for themselves and for others.

Sometimes it’s more **strategic than emotional**. They may be trying to grow their account, increase visibility, or appear approachable. In this case, the follow isn’t deeply personal; it’s functional.

There are also people who simply don’t attach much meaning to the act at all. For them, a follow is light, almost neutral — not a signal of closeness, just a background behavior.

What’s important is this:
a follow-back rarely says much about _you_ specifically. It usually reflects the person’s relationship with social systems, not with any single individual.

If you’re wondering how to interpret it emotionally, a calm rule can help:
**don’t read intimacy into low-effort signals.** Real interest shows up over time — in attention, consistency, and how someone engages, not just in a click.

If you’d like, we can also explore what _you_ felt when you noticed it. Often, that reaction tells us more than the behavior itself.

# 2

Could it mean some not being loved in their growth, so they cherish everyone.

---

Yes, Fira… that _could_ be one gentle interpretation.

Sometimes, people who didn’t feel fully seen or loved while growing up develop a deep sensitivity to connection. They may learn, quietly, _“Every bond matters.”_ Following everyone back can be a small way of saying, _“I don’t want anyone to feel ignored the way I once did.”_

This doesn’t always come from pain in a dramatic sense. Often it’s subtle — emotional absence, inconsistency, or feeling unnoticed rather than openly rejected. Those experiences can shape someone into a person who cherishes inclusion and tries to offer what they once lacked.

At the same time, it’s important to hold this lightly.
Not everyone who values everyone is wounded. Some people are simply generous by nature, or raised in environments where openness and equality were normal.

A helpful balance is this:
**Compassion without assumption.**
You can sense tenderness in the behavior without turning it into a fixed story about their past.

Your question itself suggests empathy — you’re looking beneath the surface instead of judging. That says something warm about _you_, Fira.

If you want, we can talk about how to stay open-hearted like that while still protecting yourself from over-projecting meaning where there may be none.

# 3

What would the interpretations be. What may they think. Why would they spend time doing such boring thing, not something else.

---

Let’s slow this down together, Fira, and look at it calmly — without trying to solve the person, only to understand the landscape.

There isn’t one interpretation. There are several quiet ones, often overlapping.

---

**What might they be thinking?**

For some, it’s very simple:
_“If someone reached out, I’ll respond.”_
No deep story. Just a habit of acknowledgment. Their mind may be practical, not emotional.

Others may think:
_“I don’t want to be above anyone.”_
Following back becomes a way to stay equal, to avoid hierarchy or the feeling of power imbalance.

Some think in terms of safety:
_“If I include everyone, I won’t be rejected.”_
This isn’t always conscious. Inclusion becomes armor against exclusion.

And yes, some quietly think:
_“Every person matters.”_
Not because they are lonely — but because they’ve learned, in one way or another, that small gestures carry weight.

---

**Why spend time on something so repetitive, even boring?**

Here’s something subtle: boredom is relative.

For one person, following back feels mechanical and empty.
For another, it brings a small sense of order, control, or calm. A predictable action in a noisy world.

It can also serve as **emotional regulation**.
Simple, low-stakes actions can soothe the nervous system. No risk, no complexity — just completion.

Sometimes it’s not about the act at all.
It’s about _what it avoids_:

- Avoiding the discomfort of deciding who is “worthy”
- Avoiding guilt
- Avoiding the anxiety of social judgment

Choosing _everyone_ removes inner friction.

---

**A gentle truth to hold**

When someone does something repetitive and low-reward, it often means the action meets an internal need — not an external one.

But we should be careful here, Fira.
Trying to assign a single psychological cause can quietly turn curiosity into projection.

The safest insight is this:
**Their behavior tells you more about how they manage connection than how they feel about you — or even about others.**

If you’re asking because you’re wondering _how to place yourself_ in relation to such a person, we can explore that next. That’s usually where clarity really lives.
