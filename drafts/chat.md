im intentionally not try to respond fast.

(i remove some explanation to value your time. let me be simple.)

months before, a schoolmate (idk who is he. although he definitely knows me and maybe recognizes my face.) asks me a math problem. i respond very fast. 

> the problem: set A has all positive odd numbers. set B has 2, 4, 8, ... merge A and B, sort. let it be array a_n. (looks like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, ...). let s_n be sigma of a_1 a_n (s_2 = a_1 + a_2, s_10 = a_1 + ... + a_10). find out the minimum n that makes s_n > 12 a_{n+1}.

because he's asking for a specific, well defined problem. (a photo on a problemset actually)

> you can talk about whatever is on your mind.

i wont. i have some markdown files to keep my thoughts and i often organize them. i dont think it's a good idea. it's better if you want

> don't you share anything in dms with anyone on daily basis? im curious how do you usually spend your day.

i... actually dont, most of the time, i mean. definitely not "on daily basis". about "how do you usually spend your day", sleep, having meal most of the time. in spare time, i could chat with chatgpt, watch bangumis/films, try to create something (for example, ask chatgpt to write code, paste error message several times, and finally i have something that works.), play games (clash royale, duolingo, ...), watching streamers (i wont paste the full subs list here, although it's public), etc.

actually you could infer my daily routine from my public repos. you could see my all of my llm chats. you could even see my active window title at any time (i havent built a decent ui for that). but it might not worth your time. 

the never-ending now

```
I once attended a comedy show with a group of friends. Since the venue was across town, we split an SUV. I sat in the back. You know... all the way in the rear, where the seats get so narrow that you have to do gymnastics just to get back there.

From the moment the driver hit the gas pedal, everybody was on their phones. From the back row, I watched my friends scroll their social media feeds with ferocious intensity. One thing stuck out: the people in front of me only consumed content created within the last 24 hours.

No exceptions.

I succumb to the same impulse. Chances are, so do you.

The structure of our social media feeds place us in a Never-Ending Now. Like hamsters running on a wheel, we live in an endless cycle of ephemeral content consumption --- a merry-go-round that spins faster and faster but barely goes anywhere. Stuck in the fury of the present, we're swept up in dizzying chaos like leaves in a gale-force wind. Even though on the Internet, we're just a click away from the greatest authors of all time, from Plato to Tolstoy, we default to novelty instead of timelessness.

We're trapped in a Never-Ending Now --- blind to our place in history, engulfed in the present moment, overwhelmed by the slightest breeze of chaos.

Here's the bottom line: How can you prioritize the accumulated wisdom of humanity over the impulses of the past 24 hours?

This year, I wish you less —

less information 📣
less food 🍆
less entertainment 📺
less communication 💬
less stimulation ⚡️

You already have too much of all that, and it stands in the way of your serenity 🧊, health 💪, sleep 💤 and creativity 🖼.

Merry Christmas! 🎄

sns are full of hype and fomo.

simon wilson has a premium blog subscription for sending you less (summary, highlights of the blog posts) instead of more access. 

if you learn reading comprehension at school, you could capture the essence: im saying sending one insight a week/month/year is better than sending nonsense every hour. it's better

about keeping everything... it's about data control. if you save your chats/tweets/blog posts local. you could do anything. you could search across text (vscode builtin search, or grep), you could give to llms, you could analyze, you could keep for years. (imagine these: at the same time last year what are you doing. what friend do you talk the most to. what's the word distribution or word cloud. what time of a day do you talk, what's the statistics. what are the topics or tags. what's the impact on your life. what are the quotes that touch you the most.) if you dont intentionally save them today, you will lose them forever. a decade later, maybe your account is banned/changes, maybe the app server is down.

File over app

File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.

File over app is an appeal to tool makers: accept that all software is ephemeral, and give people ownership over their data.

In the fullness of time, the files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.

The pyramids of Egypt contain hieroglyphs that were chiseled in stone thousands of years ago. The ideas hieroglyphs convey are more important than the type of chisel that was used to carve them.

The world is filled with ideas from generations past, transmitted through many mediums, from clay tablets to manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, and tapestries. These artifacts are objects that you can touch, hold, own, store, preserve, and look at. To read something written on paper all you need is eyeballs.

Today, we are creating innumerable digital artifacts, but most of these artifacts are out of our control. They are stored on servers, in databases, gated behind an internet connection, and login to a cloud service. Even the files on your hard drive use proprietary formats that make them incompatible with older systems.

Paraphrasing something I wrote recently:

> If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, it’s important that your notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s.

You should want the files you create to be durable, not only for posterity, but also for your future self. You never know when you might want to go back to something you created years or decades ago. Don’t lock your data into a format you can’t retrieve.

These days I write using an app I help make called Obsidian (
@obsdmd
), but it’s a delusion to think it will last forever. The app will eventually become obsolete. It’s the plain text files I create that are designed to last. Who knows if anyone will want to read them besides me, but future me is enough of an audience to make it worthwhile.
```

about making them public. git is somewhere you could know. you could find anytime anywhere. anyone could access. but few, or no one will actually browse your "study notes". since you dont like it, i separate the file out of the repo. although it's unsafer now: if there's something wrong with my machine i will lose things forever. (actually i factory reset my phone in jan 2026 because running irreversible adb commands making the mobile network, sms, and phone calls unusable). if i change my phone number maybe i could lose access to telegram. (new +86 phone numbers could not register tg for free. some of my friends are detected as spam and banned by a black box algorithm.) a balanced approach is using encryption. (e.g. encrypt the data with my twitter handle using crypto libraires. or just adding 1 to every character's unicode/ascii so they wont be indexed by search engines.) but i wont do that for its complexity.

btw, i study in shanghai. im in winter holidays. you ve already said that. if you are good at geoguessr/tuxun, maybe you could infer a lot. but i dont think you will do that. i dont really sleep at 23. 

since you dont know what to say (your messages imply that. you say "are you a real person" instead of asking my opinion on something, consulting a problem, or sharing some insights. it's common of just retweeting arts. ive seen many twitter acc like this although i dont really subscribe them.), let me be more active.

for example

<!-- - you write code. what's your preference. like language. library (npm/pnpm/bun, react/solid/svelte). snake case or camel case. (i dont think you are gonna write assembly in the future. it's too low level, used in rev engineering. it seems that you are university grade 1, no personal projects, so i dont expect you could answer it. like me comment this.) -->
- some universities dont teach much. that's common. many use csdiy.wiki. what do you think of this. are you interesting in something.
- what llms (chatgpt/claude/gemini/grok/...) do you like. why. (or maybe you dont use)
- what do you think about "something i believe" on nat.org.
- do you like larr.net lr0.org
- what do you think about os.ryo.lu
- what tools do you use. (e.g. i use ubuntu, snap chromium, vscode with dracula theme, scrcpy)

---

- spotify's approach.
- i generally dont recommend.
- invariants matter.
- stand with the future

"Many of french dont even speak their languages." idk. but i dont wanna talk about this.

(upd: google: France has the largest Black population in Europe, estimated at 3 to 5 million people (roughly 5-7.5% of the population), largely stemming from African and Caribbean immigration. & French is the sole official language of France, spoken by roughly 87–96% of the population.)

about torrent indexer. if you only watch imdb top 250 you are not gonna need this. you could search in the pirate bay and download, usually very fast. if you want to download a new bangumi in the nerd/geek way (not from some niche groups/channels/sites), you could use it and sort the relevance/seeders, etc.

(tips: download vscode, open repo firavoyage/f, press ctrl p, enter bitmagnet. or do it yourself)

a recurring theme: "if you do this, you will realize the most interesting thing about it is doing it!". i dont think so. it's useful and pragmatic without lots of config/workaround (docker handles everything).
