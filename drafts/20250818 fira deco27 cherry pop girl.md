explain 重女

---

“重女” (zhòng nǚ) is a term originating from Japanese anime and manga culture, which has been adopted by Chinese internet slang. Here’s a breakdown of its meaning and usage:

### 1. **Literal Meaning**:

- **重 (zhòng/jū)**: Can mean "heavy," "serious," or "intense."
- **女 (nǚ)**: Means "girl" or "woman."
- Combined, it refers to a girl with "heavy" or intense traits, often emotionally or psychologically.

### 2. **Definition**:

A "重女" describes a female character (or real person) who exhibits extreme emotional intensity, often in relationships or personal struggles. Traits may include:

- Obsessive love or attachment.
- Emotional volatility (e.g., mood swings, jealousy).
- Self-destructive tendencies or dark pasts.
- A dramatic, "overbearing" presence in narratives.

### 3. **Examples in Media**:

- Anime/manga: Characters like **Makima** (_Chainsaw Man_), **Homura** (_Madoka Magica_), or **Gasai Yuno** (_Future Diary_) fit the "重女" archetype due to their intense, often unhealthy emotional dynamics.
- Real-life use: May describe someone overly clingy or emotionally draining in relationships.

### 4. **Contrast with "Light" Characters**:

Unlike cheerful, carefree characters ("軽女," meaning "light girls"), 重女 carry a sense of emotional weight, often driving serious or tragic plotlines.

### 5. **Internet Slang Nuance**:

- Sometimes used humorously to describe overly dramatic behavior.
- Can be pejorative if criticizing someone for being "too much," but may also express fascination with complex characters.

### 6. **Similar Terms**:

- **病娇 (yandere)**: A subset of 重女, specifically combining affection with violent possessiveness.
- **郁女 (depressed girls)**: Focuses more on melancholy than intensity.
