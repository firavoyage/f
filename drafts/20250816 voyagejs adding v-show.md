## does other frameworks have something like v-show

Yes! Many frontend frameworks have a similar feature to Vue's `v-show`, which toggles the visibility of an element by controlling its CSS `display` property (rather than adding/removing it from the DOM like `v-if` does). Here are equivalents in other frameworks:

### **1. React**

React doesn't have a built-in directive like `v-show`, but you can achieve the same effect by conditionally applying a style:

```jsx
<div style={{ display: isVisible ? "block" : "none" }}>
  This is conditionally visible
</div>
```

Or using a class:

```jsx
<div className={isVisible ? "visible" : "hidden"}>
  This is conditionally visible
</div>
```

```css
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

### **2. Angular**

Angular has `[hidden]`, which works similarly to `v-show`:

```html
<div [hidden]="!isVisible">This is conditionally visible</div>
```

(Note: This uses `display: none` under the hood.)

Alternatively, you can use `*ngIf` (which removes the element from the DOM, like Vue's `v-if`).

### **3. Svelte**

Svelte has a `style` directive that can control `display`:

```svelte
<div style:display={isVisible ? 'block' : 'none'}>
  This is conditionally visible
</div>
```

Or using a class:

```svelte
<div class={isVisible ? '' : 'hidden'}>
  This is conditionally visible
</div>
```

```css
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

### **4. Alpine.js**

Alpine.js has `x-show`, which works almost identically to Vue's `v-show`:

```html
<div x-show="isVisible">This is conditionally visible</div>
```

### **5. SolidJS**

SolidJS doesn't have a built-in `v-show` equivalent, but you can manually control `display`:

```jsx
<div style={{ display: isVisible() ? "block" : "none" }}>
  This is conditionally visible
</div>
```

### **Comparison Table**

| Framework | `v-show` Equivalent                                   | Notes                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Vue       | `v-show`                                              | Toggles `display: none` |
| React     | `style={{ display: isVisible ? 'block' : 'none' }}`   | Manual control          |
| Angular   | `[hidden]="!isVisible"`                               | Uses `display: none`    |
| Svelte    | `style:display={isVisible ? 'block' : 'none'}`        | Manual or class-based   |
| Alpine.js | `x-show`                                              | Works like `v-show`     |
| SolidJS   | `style={{ display: isVisible() ? 'block' : 'none' }}` | Manual control          |

### **Key Difference from `v-if` (or `*ngIf`/React conditional rendering)**

- `v-show` (and equivalents) **keeps the element in the DOM** but hides it with CSS.
- `v-if` (or `*ngIf`/React `{condition && <div>}`) **removes the element from the DOM entirely**.

## should i implement this in my custom framework? i think css has so many props, idk why should i add a special prop just for display:none

You raise a great point! If you're building your own framework, you should carefully consider whether adding a dedicated `v-show`-like feature is worth it, since CSS already provides multiple ways to handle visibility (`display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, `opacity: 0`, etc.).

### **Pros of Adding a `v-show`-Like Feature**

1. **Convenience** – A dedicated directive simplifies a common use case (toggling visibility) without forcing users to write manual styles.
   - Instead of:
     ```html
     <div style={{ display: isVisible ? 'block' : 'none' }}>...</div>
     ```
   - Users can write:
     ```html
     <div show="{isVisible}">...</div>
     ```
2. **Consistency** – Encourages a standard way to handle visibility across the codebase.
3. **Performance Optimization** – If your framework has reactivity, a built-in `show` directive could optimize re-renders (e.g., skipping updates for hidden elements).

### **Cons of Adding It**

1. **CSS Already Does This** – As you mentioned, `display: none` is just one of many CSS properties, and users might prefer handling it manually.
2. **Framework Bloat** – Every new feature increases complexity. If `style`/`class` bindings already cover this, is a dedicated feature necessary?
3. **Flexibility Trade-off** – A `show` directive locks users into `display: none`, but sometimes they might want `visibility: hidden`, `opacity: 0`, or `height: 0` instead.

### **Alternative Approaches**

1. **Just Use `style`/`class` Bindings**

   - Let users handle visibility with standard CSS.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <div style={{ display: isVisible ? 'block' : 'none' }}>...</div>
     ```
   - Or with classes:
     ```html
     <div class={isVisible ? 'block' : 'hidden'}>...</div>
     ```
     ```css
     .hidden {
       display: none;
     }
     ```

2. **Provide a Utility Function (Instead of a Directive)**

   - If you want to reduce boilerplate but avoid framework bloat, expose a helper:
     ```js
     function showIf(condition, display = "block") {
       return { display: condition ? display : "none" };
     }
     ```
     ```html
     <div style="{showIf(isVisible)}">...</div>
     ```

3. **Make It Configurable (If You Really Want a Directive)**
   - Allow users to define what "hiding" means:
     ```html
     <div show="{isVisible}" show-mode="visibility">...</div>
     ```
     (Where `show-mode` could map to `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, etc.)

### **Final Recommendation**

- **If your framework is minimal**, avoid adding a dedicated `show` feature—let users handle it with CSS.
- **If your framework prioritizes developer experience**, consider adding it for ergonomics (but keep it simple).
- **If you’re unsure**, start without it and see if users frequently request such a feature.
