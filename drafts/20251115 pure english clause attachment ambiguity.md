can i know exactly where a clause belongs to in english, like a which is b which is c, whether c belongs to a or b, without knowing what a and b is.

Excellent question. This gets to the heart of a common ambiguity in English grammar.

The short answer is: **No, you cannot know for certain without more context.**

A structure like "A which is B which is C" is grammatically ambiguous. It can logically be read in two ways, and only the meaning of A, B, and C (or additional context) can resolve it.

Let's break down the two possibilities.

### The Two Interpretations

#### 1. Nested Interpretation (C belongs to B)

In this reading, the second "which" clause ("which is C") modifies the noun phrase immediately before it, which is "B".

- **Structure:** `A (which is B (which is C))`
- **Meaning:** There is an A. This A is a B. Furthermore, this B is a C.
- **Conclusion:** C describes B, which in turn describes A.

**Example:**

> "I live in a **house** which is a **Victorian building** which is a **protected heritage site**."

- Analysis:
  - The house is a Victorian building.
  - The Victorian building is a protected heritage site.
  - Therefore, the _house_ is the protected heritage site.
  - Here, "which is a protected heritage site" tells us more about the "Victorian building."

#### 2. Chained Interpretation (C belongs to A)

In this reading, both "which" clauses independently modify the original subject, "A". The "B" is just additional information about A, and "C" is another piece of information about A.

- **Structure:** `A (which is B) (which is C)`
- **Meaning:** There is an A. This A is a B. This same A is also a C.
- **Conclusion:** Both B and C directly describe A.

**Example:**

> "We studied the **proposal** which is a **draft document** which is **confidential**."

- Analysis:
  - The proposal is a draft document.
  - The proposal is confidential.
  - "Confidential" describes the proposal itself, not just the "draft document." It's not that all draft documents are confidential, but _this_ proposal is.
  - Here, "which is confidential" tells us more about the "proposal."

### How to Resolve the Ambiguity

Since the grammar alone doesn't tell you, you need to rely on these factors:

1.  **Logic and Real-World Knowledge:** This is the most powerful tool.

    - In the first example, it makes logical sense that a specific type of _building_ (Victorian) is a heritage site, and the house is that building.
    - In the second example, it's logical that a _proposal_ can be confidential, regardless of it being a draft.

2.  **Punctuation and Pausing:** In spoken English, a pause before the second "which" can signal a new clause referring back to A. In writing, this is sometimes (but not always) indicated by a comma.

    - _Chained (with comma):_ "We studied the **proposal**, which is a draft document, which is confidential." (This strongly suggests both clauses modify "proposal").

3.  **Rewriting for Clarity:** Good writers avoid this ambiguous structure. They would rewrite for clarity.
    - To show C belongs to B: "I live in a **house** that is a **Victorian building, which is** a protected heritage site."
    - To show both B and C belong to A: "We studied the **proposal**, **which is** both a draft document and confidential." OR "We studied the **proposal**, a draft document that is confidential."

### Conclusion

To directly answer your question: **Without knowing what A, B, and C are, the phrase "A which is B which is C" is structurally ambiguous.**

You must use context and logic to determine whether the second relative clause ("which is C") is modifying the nearest noun (B) or "jumping back" to modify the main subject (A).

give examples in a broader range

---

Of course. This ambiguity isn't limited to the "which is" pattern. It can occur with various types of modifying clauses and phrases. The core principle is that a modifier _tends_ to attach to the nearest possible noun, but it can logically "reach back" to an earlier one if it makes more sense.

Here are examples across a broader range of grammatical structures.

### 1. Multiple Prepositional Phrases

This is one of the most common areas for ambiguity. The question is: what does the final prepositional phrase modify?

**Ambiguous Sentence:** "He saw a **man** on the **hill** with a **telescope**."

- **Interpretation A (The man has the telescope):** The phrase "with a telescope" modifies "man."
  - _Meaning:_ He saw a man. The man was on the hill. The man had a telescope.
- **Interpretation B (The hill has the telescope):** The phrase "with a telescope" modifies "hill."
  - _Meaning:_ He saw a man. The man was on a hill. The hill had a telescope on it. (This is less logical, but grammatically possible).
- **Interpretation C (He used the telescope to see):** The phrase "with a telescope" modifies the verb "saw."
  - _Meaning:_ Using a telescope, he saw a man on the hill.

**Another Example:** "She reviewed the **study** of the **data** from **2019**."

- **Interpretation A (The study is from 2019):** "From 2019" modifies "study."
  - _Meaning:_ The study was conducted in 2019, and it was about the data.
- **Interpretation B (The data is from 2019):** "From 2019" modifies "data."
  - _Meaning:_ She reviewed a study. The study was about data, and that data came from the year 2019.

### 2. A Series of Relative Clauses (Your Original Pattern, Expanded)

**Ambiguous Sentence:** "The **company** hired the **designer** who recommended the **contractor** that we fired."

- **Interpretation A (We fired the contractor):** "That we fired" modifies the nearest noun, "contractor."
  - _Meaning:_ The designer recommended a specific contractor. We fired that contractor. This is the most likely reading.
- **Interpretation B (We fired the designer):** "That we fired" reaches back to modify "designer." This is non-standard and confusing, but the structure allows it.
  - _Meaning:_ The company hired a designer. We fired that designer. This designer had previously recommended a contractor.

### 3. Participial Phrases (-ing or -ed phrases)

These phrases describe a noun, but which one?

**Ambiguous Sentence:** "The **servant** accompanied the **child** wearing a **blue suit**."

- **Interpretation A (The child is wearing the suit):** "Wearing a blue suit" modifies the nearest noun, "child."
  - _Meaning:_ The servant accompanied the child, and the child was wearing a blue suit.
- **Interpretation B (The servant is wearing the suit):** "Wearing a blue suit" reaches back to modify "servant."
  - _Meaning:_ The servant, who was wearing a blue suit, accompanied the child.

**Another Example:** "I was photographing the **bird** in the **bush** holding my **breath**."

- **Interpretation A (The bush is 'holding its breath' - illogical):** Modifies the nearest noun, "bush." This is nonsensical.
- **Interpretation B (I was holding my breath):** Reaches back to modify the subject "I."
  - _Meaning:_ Holding my breath, I was photographing the bird in the bush.

### 4. Conjoined Nouns Followed by a Modifier

When "and" joins two nouns, a modifier that follows can apply to one or both.

**Ambiguous Sentence:** "They sell **cakes** and **pastries** for **dogs**."

- **Interpretation A (Only the pastries are for dogs):** "For dogs" modifies only "pastries."
  - _Meaning:_ They sell cakes for everyone, and pastries specifically made for dogs.
- **Interpretation B (Both cakes and pastries are for dogs):** "For dogs" modifies the entire phrase "cakes and pastries."
  - _Meaning:_ They sell dog cakes and dog pastries.

---

### 5. Adverbial Clauses (Modifying the Verb)

These clauses can sometimes be ambiguously attached to different parts of the sentence.

**Ambiguous Sentence:** "She said **yesterday** she was leaving."

- **Interpretation A ("Yesterday" modifies "said"):** The act of speaking happened yesterday.
  - _Meaning:_ Yesterday, she said, "I am leaving."
- **Interpretation B ("Yesterday" modifies "was leaving"):** The act of leaving was scheduled for yesterday.
  - _Meaning:_ She said, "I am leaving yesterday."

### How to Solve the Ambiguity Every Time

As with your original example, the solution is never in the raw structure alone. You must use:

1.  **Real-World Logic:** Is it logical for a bush to hold its breath? No. Therefore, "I" must be holding my breath. Is it common to have pastries for dogs? Maybe. But cakes for dogs? That's less common, so Interpretation A is more likely without context.
2.  **Context from the Broader Text:** The sentences before and after will usually provide the clues.
3.  **Punctuation:** Commas can often signal the intended attachment.
    - _"The servant, wearing a blue suit, accompanied the child."_ (Clearly, the servant has the suit).
    - _"The servant accompanied the child, wearing a blue suit."_ (Still slightly ambiguous, but now leans toward the child having the suit).
4.  **Rewriting:** The best solution is often to rewrite for absolute clarity.
    - _"The servant, who was wearing a blue suit, accompanied the child."_
    - _"The servant accompanied the child, who was wearing a blue suit."_

In summary, while grammatical rules provide a "most likely" attachment (usually the nearest noun), **English syntax frequently creates these garden paths.** The final arbiter is always meaning and context.
