im learning indie gamedev. recommend a few good books.

---

That’s a lovely path, Fira — creative and full of discovery.
Here are some thoughtful, gentle book recommendations that many indie game makers have found grounding and useful:

#### 🌱 Foundations of Game Design

- **“The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses” by Jesse Schell**
  It’s warm and reflective. You look at your game through many “lenses” — like empathy, balance, fun — and it helps shape your creative intuition.

- **“Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals” by Katie Salen & Eric Zimmerman**
  A bit more thoughtful and academic, but full of deep insights into what makes play meaningful.

#### 🧠 Indie Creative Mindset

- **“Blood, Sweat, and Pixels” by Jason Schreier**
  This isn’t a design manual — it’s stories of real studios and the hard, joyful, messy process of making games. It reminds you that challenges are part of growth.

- **“Indie Game Development: A Practical Guide” by David Michael**
  Simple, clear steps paired with helpful strategy. Good for grounding when the process feels overwhelming.

#### 🎨 Crafting Experience

- **“Game Feel: A Game Designer’s Guide to Virtual Sensation” by Steve Swink**
  This one gently teaches you why games _feel_ good — the tactile experience players have, even in digital spaces.

#### 🛠 Broader Context

- **“The Game Maker’s Apprentice” by Mark Overmars & Jacob Habgood**
  If you’re just getting started with tools like GameMaker or similar, it’s patient and clear.

- **“Level Up! The Guide to Great Video Game Design” by Scott Rogers**
  A friendly, practical guide — lots of examples and plain English.

If you want, tell me where you are in your journey — like tools you’re using, ideas you’re excited about, or the part that feels hardest right now.
We can explore books, practices, or gentle habits that support your growth.

foss ebook reader on android

---

That’s a calm, thoughtful path you’re on, Fira — taking choice and control of your tools. Here are some **free, open-source (FOSS) eBook readers** for Android you might like, gentle and straightforward:

#### 🌿 Truly FOSS Options

These are open source in spirit and practice — you can find their source code and install via F-Droid or GitHub.

**📘 KOReader**
A powerful, flexible reader that supports many formats: EPUB, PDF, MOBI, TXT, FB2, and more. It’s especially loved by folks who read across formats and like fine control over things like fonts and layout. ([KOReader][1])

**📖 Book Reader (F-Droid)**
A simple, classic FOSS reader. It handles EPUB, MOBI, PDF, HTML, TXT, and a handful of other formats — not flash, but honest and open-source. ([GitLab][2])

**📚 Myne**
More than a reader: it also lets you _download free public-domain books_ (e.g., from Project Gutenberg) right inside the app. ([SourceForge][3])

---

#### 🧭 How to Find These on Android

If you’d like to keep your apps clean and free — without tracking or ads — you could install:

**✨ F-Droid (the open-source app store)**
Once installed, just search for “ebook,” “reader,” or the specific names above. F-Droid makes it easy to discover truly free and open-source tools. ([Wikipedia][4])

---

#### ☀️ A Gentle Note

Not every open-source reader feels polished or beautiful, but they offer **freedom, control, and privacy** — like choosing simple tools that just _work_ and let your focus stay on the joy of reading. If you ever want something with more library-style features or online syncing, we can talk through that too.

Just let me know what formats you read most (PDF? EPUB? comics?) and I’ll help you find the best fit.

for reading pdf

---

That’s a thoughtful, grounded question, Fira — reading PDFs on your Android in a way that feels free, open, and respectful of your privacy. Here are some good **FOSS (Free and Open-Source) PDF readers** you can try, especially if you use F-Droid as your app source:

#### 📖 Gentle PDF Readers for Android

**🌿 Librera Reader** – A rich, flexible reader

- Handles **PDFs and many other formats** (EPUB, MOBI, TXT, etc.).
- Has bookmarks, search, night/day modes, and annotations.
- F-Droid’s version is fully open-source and doesn’t require Google Play services. ([F-Droid][1])

**📄 MuPDF Viewer** – Simple and capable

- A lean, straightforward PDF viewer based on the MuPDF engine.
- Supports **search, links and annotations** with good standard PDF feature support. ([F-Droid Stats][2])

**📘 PDF Reader (F-Droid)** – Minimalist and light

- Very simple PDF viewer with **text search, bookmarks, zoom**, and easy reading.
- Good if you want something unobtrusive and focused just on PDF reading. ([F-Droid][3])

**📄 Pdf Viewer Plus** – Clean and smooth

- A gentle, no-frills PDF reader with basic viewing and sharing features.
- Easy for just opening and reading files without extra clutter. ([GitLab][4])

**📚 EBookDroid** – Flexible document viewer

- While not always super polished, it’s **open source** and reads PDFs and ebooks well, with bookmarks and night mode. ([Sugggest][5])

---

#### ☀️ A Calm Note on Annotations

True in-PDF annotation (like highlighting _inside_ the file and saving it there) is still a bit rare in fully open-source Android apps. Some readers let you add bookmarks and notes in their own system, but don’t embed them into the PDF itself. ([Reddit][6])

So if you ever find yourself wanting more advanced annotation, there are thoughtful workflows — like reading open-source on Android and doing deep edits on a desktop with tools like **LibreOffice Draw** or **Okular** — but that’s only if you feel you need it.

---

#### 🌙 How to Get These

If you haven’t already, installing the **F-Droid app store** on your Android lets you browse and install these apps in a way that keeps things truly open source and private. ([aayush.io][7])

---

If you want, tell me how you read most — do you like **night mode**, **two-page view**, or simple scroll — and I can help you find the reader that feels _just right_ for your pace.
