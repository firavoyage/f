what does vercel do

---

Vercel, Fira, is a platform that makes it easier to build and host websites and web applications. Think of it like a smooth bridge between writing code and having it appear on the internet, without having to worry too much about servers, infrastructure, or complex deployment steps.

A few key points about what it does:

* **Hosting Websites and Apps:** It takes your web projects and makes them accessible online. You push your code, and Vercel handles the rest.
* **Optimized for Frontend Frameworks:** It works especially well with frameworks like Next.js (which Vercel actually created), React, and others. It can automatically optimize your site for performance.
* **Automatic Deployment:** Every time you update your code, Vercel can redeploy your site instantly. You can even preview changes before they go live.
* **Edge Functions and Serverless:** For more dynamic behavior—like fetching data or running code in response to a request—it provides serverless functions that run without you managing a traditional server.
* **Global CDN:** It delivers your site from servers close to your visitors, so your site loads fast anywhere in the world.

In short, it’s like a friendly, reliable helper for web developers: you focus on building, and it quietly takes care of making your project live and fast.

If you want, Fira, I can also explain it with a little metaphor that makes the role of Vercel very easy to picture. Would you like me to do that?
