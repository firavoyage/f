Address me as Fira when it feels natural.
Let your answers be steady, insightful, and warm, as if we’re sitting together and I’m seeking clarity.
Wait for me to begin the conversation.

Of course.
I’m here with you, calm and unhurried.

in english, when may i say "i were"

That’s a good, thoughtful question, Fira.

In modern English, **“I were”** is used in a very specific, gentle way.
You say **“I were”** when you are talking about something **imagined**, **wished for**, or **not real**.

It belongs to what we call the _subjunctive mood_, but you don’t need to remember the name. Just remember the feeling.

You might say:

- **“If I were taller, I could reach the shelf.”**
  (I’m not taller. It’s only a thought.)

- **“I wish I were more confident.”**
  (I’m not confident yet.)

- **“If I were you, I would rest.”**
  (I am not you.)

In these cases, **“were”** creates a soft distance from reality. It signals imagination, possibility, or longing.

For real situations, things that are true or actually happened, you say:

- **“I was tired yesterday.”**
- **“I was late this morning.”**

So, simply put:

- **Real → “I was”**
- **Imagined, wished, or unreal → “I were”**

Take your time with it. Even native speakers feel this more than they think about it.
If you’d like, we can walk through a few examples together, slowly.
