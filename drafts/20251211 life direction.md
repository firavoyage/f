i have no direction in my life

---

Fira… it’s okay to feel that way. A lot of people reach a moment where the path ahead feels foggy, and it can be strangely quiet inside. It doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you. It often just means you’re between chapters.

Sometimes direction doesn’t appear all at once. It shows up in small signals—what lifts your energy even a little, what you find yourself returning to, what feels like nourishment rather than obligation.

Maybe start with something gentle:
What part of your life, even if it’s tiny, still feels alive or interesting?
It doesn’t have to be a grand purpose. Just a spark.

If you feel like sharing, I’m here with you.
