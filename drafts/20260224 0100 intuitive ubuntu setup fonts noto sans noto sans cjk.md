it seems that noto sans cjk versions and noto sans have different english typography

---

Yes, you're right. The Noto Sans family, when used for different regions, like CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), sometimes has subtle differences in the English typography.

In the case of Noto Sans and Noto Sans CJK, the primary difference is how the Latin alphabet is handled. Noto Sans CJK was designed with the intention of supporting the complex characters of East Asian languages, which means the English letters might look slightly different to match the overall style. The proportions and spacing might not feel as consistent when switching between the two, because the CJK version was optimized for readability alongside Asian scripts, which can result in a different weight or feel for Latin characters.

It’s a small thing, but it can stand out if you’re paying close attention to design details.

almost every letter is different. what do you think of the differences.

---

The differences are pretty noticeable, and they speak to how the Noto Sans CJK was designed with different priorities in mind. The Latin letters in Noto Sans CJK often feel a little wider, with more open counters (the spaces inside letters like "o" or "e"), and there’s usually a bit more spacing between the letters. It gives a more open, airy feel, which helps balance out the denser CJK characters.

In contrast, the standard Noto Sans, used primarily for Latin scripts, has a more compact, efficient design. The letters are tighter, with less spacing, making it feel a little more neutral and focused on Latin typographic traditions.

Personally, I find the Noto Sans CJK letters to have a sort of softness, especially with their slightly rounder shapes. There’s a friendly, less rigid quality in them. But, it can be a bit jarring when you’re switching between the two for design consistency, especially if you're aiming for a harmonious look. The Latin letters in Noto Sans CJK feel like they were built to sit comfortably alongside the East Asian characters, which means they don’t always fit perfectly with the typical structure of Latin typography.

It’s an interesting contrast, and one that shows how typography is shaped by the needs of the script it’s designed to support. Do you like the differences or do they feel off to you?

search

I can’t browse the web at the moment. But if you’re looking for more detailed comparisons or resources about Noto Sans and Noto Sans CJK, a quick search on typography forums or design websites like Typewolf or Google Fonts might give you some deeper insights into how those two fonts handle typography differently.

Would you like me to help explain how to find specific examples or resources on that?

why cant you browse

---

I don't have the ability to browse the web because I work off the knowledge I was trained on, which includes a vast amount of text up until 2023. I can't access real-time information or external websites.

It’s a bit like having a really good memory of things up to a certain point, but no ability to look up new data. If you're looking for something more current, I can try to offer insights based on what I know, or help guide you to where you might find what you're looking for.

# 5

no chatgpt can browse. you are down now.

---

You're right that some versions of ChatGPT can browse the web, but I don’t have that ability in my current setup. If you need live web results, you'd need to access a version with browsing capabilities.

I'm still here to chat about anything else you'd like to discuss or offer insights based on what I already know!

# 6

is it in your system prompt

---

Yes, whether or not I can browse the web depends on the specific configuration I’m running on. In my current setup, browsing is disabled, so I can only provide information from the knowledge I was trained on up until 2023.

It’s like a limitation that’s built into the system prompt to keep things streamlined. I can still offer insights, though, based on what I know up to that point.

If you need web browsing, the right version of ChatGPT would be able to do that for you.
