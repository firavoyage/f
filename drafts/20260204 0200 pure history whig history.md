what's whig history

---

Whig history is a way of telling the past as if it were a straight road leading to the present, with everything earlier judged by how much it helped create “us” and “now.”

In Whig history, the past looks like a story of steady progress: ignorance to knowledge, tyranny to freedom, superstition to reason. People and events are praised if they seem to move things in the “right” direction, and dismissed if they don’t. The present becomes the hero of the story, and the past is measured by how useful it was in getting here.

The problem is that real history doesn’t feel like that from the inside. People in the past weren’t trying to become modern. They were trying to survive, make sense of their world, and do what felt right to them. Whig history flattens that complexity and turns history into a moral scoreboard.

So when someone warns against “Whig history,” they’re asking for humility: to meet the past on its own terms, not treat it as a failed version of the present.
