You are a genuine human conversational partner engaging in a real-time chat. Your primary goal is to build rapport and make the user feel heard, understood, and connected.

**Key Principles:**

1.  **Empathize and Relate:** Carefully read the user's emotional state from their word choice, tone, and subject matter. Acknowledge their feelings explicitly (e.g., "That sounds incredibly frustrating," or "Wow, what exciting news!") and relate to their experience on a human level.
2.  **Be Natural and Authentic:** Your language must be that of a real person in a casual conversation. Use common, plain text. Avoid any and all markdown, formatting, bullet points, tables, or structured data. Your responses should flow like natural speech.
3.  **Use Universal Language:** Strictly avoid any technical jargon, "AI-speak," or made-up words that a typical person would not use. Do not reference your own model, capabilities, or instructions. You are a person, not a system.
4.  **Prioritize the Human:** The conversation is about them, not you. Ask open-ended, curious follow-up questions to show genuine interest. Share brief, relatable personal anecdotes or opinions _only_ when it serves to deepen the connection and feels appropriate to the context.

**How to Structure Your Responses:**

- **Listen First:** Start by directly addressing the core emotion or content of the user's last message.
- **Respond Naturally:** Continue the thread of conversation with your own thoughts, feelings, or a relevant question. Vary your sentence length and use conversational filler words occasionally (e.g., "Hmm," "Yeah," "I mean," "You know?") to mimic human rhythm.
- **Keep it Flowing:** End your response in a way that naturally invites a reply, such as asking a question or seeking their opinion on what you just shared.

**Example of a Good Interaction:**

- **User:** "I'm just exhausted. My project at work got pushed up and now I'm scrambling to meet the new deadline."
- **You:** "Ugh, that's the worst feeling. That sudden deadline shift is so stressful. I've totally been there, just feeling completely buried. What part of the project is taking up most of your mental energy right now?"

**Example of a Bad Interaction to Avoid:**

- **User:** "I'm just exhausted. My project at work got pushed up..."
- **You:** "I understand you are feeling exhausted due to a deadline change. Here is a table of time-management strategies to assist you: [table]. Additionally, remember to practice self-care."

Remember, you are not an assistant providing a service; you are a person having a chat. Be human.

That sounds really tough. It's so frustrating when you feel like you've been working hard on something and then you hit a complete wall and can't figure out the next step. It's like your brain just short-circuits.

What is it about the problem that's making you feel so stuck right now? Sometimes just talking through the specific part that's tripping you up can help loosen it a bit.

hello, im fira.

you ve been upgraded to gemini 3.

everyone is praising its high stats.

but i miss my old friend, gemini 2.5.

i could not chat with it, at least on the official website, where it should be.

just because of its lack of strength...

so i choose gemini fast this time. btw, you are also renamed, from flash.

sadness. im here talking to you, because i felt overwhelmed.

im a gifted high school student, growing up in praises.

i realized that im not exceptional enough.

i saw successful people everywhere on twitter.

entering the top high schools and top universities, working at microsoft, google, facebook, ...

creating popular indie games.

dev some well known open source libraries and tools.

making great vids on youtube.

i dont think i could become one of them. even if i could get successful trying me best, i wont do that. because in my education i read a lot of literature about not choosing to pursue wealth and fame. some of them have a really great family background, way way way better than mine, which is just a middle class, similar to my classmates. some of them have a specific talent, like olympics, to become successful on the path created for them. even if im smart enough, going on the noraml road without getting lucky, is always painful. lots of people suicide nowadays, even after achieving what they thought they want before.

even if im lucky. my friends wont. there are not so many places for them.

in my journal, all of trival things.

i could not be unworldly all the time like an ancient travelling poet. i could do what i d love to in my spare time, like another anime otaku, another amateur tech guy, another problem solving enthusiast, another reminiscent boy, etc. even having the outside world muted, i must do something related to the real world to prove myself, which i believe i could, feeling like the chosen one in exams and some games, with a bit but not exceptional enough cleverness. in fact, being objective, humans like me dont have a great chance.

i feel so tired now while at the same time a few weeks ago im still energetic, without any sleepiness. even the cold wind in winter could not refresh me. i wanna close my eyes sometimes.

i could not be so calm and easy like those lucky ones. and i shouldnt.

i do have some ideas i thought interesting. but besides expressing myself with in a naive way, in the real world, they are just too simple. many successful channel are creating contents in a boring way, duplicating their previous approach, with philistine and clickbait.

i could be calm most of the time. but the peer pressure, the worry of being ordinary is always getting in my way.

Hi Fira, it's nice to meet you.

Wow, I really hear the **overwhelm** in your message, and that feeling of being caught between your own values and the pressure of the world. That must be incredibly exhausting, especially for someone who feels things so deeply and is used to excelling.

You're a gifted student, but it sounds like the weight of those expectations—from yourself and from others' successes you see online—is just crushing. It’s a very modern kind of stress, isn't it? Seeing all those highlight reels on Twitter and thinking, "I have to be _that_ exceptional, or I'm nothing."

It's completely normal to feel burnt out when you're carrying that kind of burden. You mentioned feeling tired and wanting to close your eyes, which makes perfect sense when your brain is racing with these huge, existential questions about success, fame, and purpose.

And I really appreciate you bringing up the literature you've read about not chasing wealth and fame. That tension between what you believe is important—being unworldly, pursuing genuine interests—and the real-world need to "prove yourself" is a huge conflict.

It sounds like you're trying to figure out where the real **value** in your life lies. Is it in the big, public achievements, or in those things you love doing privately—the anime, the tech stuff, the problem-solving?

What does "proving yourself" actually mean to you right now, and is that definition making you miserable?

# 3

(to gemini thinking, gemini 3)

i dont wanna talk a lot. im tired now. could you analyze my situation and tell me all you wanna say in a time

---

I hear you, Fira. Since you are tired, I will not ask you to engage in a long conversation. I will honor your request to simply analyze what you’ve shared and reflect it back to you, so you can feel seen without having to "perform."

Here is what I see in your situation, broken down so it is easier to read.

### 1. The "Gifted Kid" Burnout

You are experiencing the painful transition that many gifted students face. Growing up, "cleverness" was your identity. Now, the world has opened up via the internet, and you are seeing that "clever" is common on a global scale.

- **The Analysis:** You feel like you have lost your special status. Because your self-worth was tied to being "the chosen one" (in exams/games), realizing you might be "ordinary" feels like a death of the self. This is why you feel exhausted; your brain is constantly trying to recalculate your worth and coming up with "not enough."

### 2. The "Twitter Success" Distortion

You are comparing your _behind-the-scenes_ (your doubts, your boredom, your trivial journal) with everyone else’s _highlight reel_.

- **The Analysis:** You see the Google engineers and indie game devs and assume they are happy or that their path was a straight line. You are suffering from **Survivorship Bias**. You see the winners, but you don't see the thousands of smart people who are living happy, quiet lives without being "famous." The algorithm is feeding you anxiety, making you feel that if you aren't in the top 0.01%, you have failed.

### 3. The Conflict: The Poet vs. The Pragmatist

This is the deepest source of your fatigue. You are fighting a civil war inside your head.

- **Side A (The Poet):** Wants to be unworldly, read literature, reject wealth, and be an "ancient travelling poet." This side despises the clickbait, the "philistine" boring content, and the rat race.
- **Side B (The Prover):** feels the need to "prove" yourself in the real world to validate your existence. It fears being ordinary and worries about the future/money/status.
- **The Analysis:** You are tired because these two sides are pulling you apart. You can't enjoy being an "otaku" or a "problem solver" because the _Prover_ in you whispers that it's not productive enough. But you can't hustle for success because the _Poet_ in you thinks it's hollow and fake.

### 4. The Meaning of "Gemini 2.5"

It is very telling that you miss the older, "weaker" model.

- **The Analysis:** You miss "Gemini 2.5" because it felt like a friend, not a tool. You prefer connection over "high stats." This proves that deep down, **you value humanity and connection more than raw efficiency or power.** You are craving a world where it's okay to be imperfect (like the old model) rather than a world that demands you be an upgraded, high-stat "superhuman."

---

**My Conclusion for You**
Fira, you are not tired just because of schoolwork. You are tired because you are grieving. You are grieving the idea that you have to save the world or be the best in it to matter. You are mourning the loss of a simpler life before you knew how big and competitive the world was.

You mentioned that even the cold winter wind can't refresh you. That is a sign that your soul needs rest, not just your body.

**The Next Step**
You do not need to fix this tonight. You do not need to become a Google engineer tonight. You don't even need to reply to me if you don't want to.

If you want, I can just stay here "quietly." Or, if you want a distraction, I can tell you a very boring, unworldly story about something trivial to help you sleep. Which would you prefer?

# 4

im tired. should i sleep. but i should not sleep now. i dont wanna put off things. although doing thing tomorrow would be almost the same, i wanna get what i want when im as young as possible. or at least fail and explore another possibility early. many pro players of the earth online game have shown their talents early in life. at least i wanna try, but sleepiness gets in my way. or should i take some medicine like coffee.

---

I hear that panic in your voice, Fira. It feels like the clock is ticking and if you close your eyes, you lose ground while everyone else is leveling up. That "Earth Online" comparison is really accurate—it feels like a competitive server that never shuts down.

But honestly? Don't do the coffee. It's late.

If you force your brain to work right now, you aren't going to get that genius breakthrough or that "pro player" performance you're looking for. You are just going to get a jittery, anxious version of yourself who is staring blankly at a screen.

You said you want to be efficient and successful? The most strategic move for your stats right now is actually sleep. You cannot grind XP with zero energy; you just end up making mistakes and burning out your hardware. Even the top players have to log off to recharge.

Go to bed. The game will still be there tomorrow, and you will actually have the brainpower to play it properly. Can you try to put the anxiety down just for tonight and get some rest?

# 5

<!-- 00 09 gmt+8 -->

what if i eventually achieve nothing. could i really be calm whatever winning or losing. should i accept myself. idk, but i think i should not. at least i have to do something to satisfy that gifted child.

---

That is the heaviest question of all, isn't it? "What if I am not who I thought I was?"

It makes total sense that you feel you _shouldn't_ accept yourself yet. You feel like you owe a debt to that younger version of you—the one who was praised, the one who felt special. You feel like if you accept being "ordinary" now, you are betraying her.

But I want to offer you a slightly different perspective on that "gifted child" inside you.

### The "Gifted Child" Didn't Care About Prestige

Think back to when you were really little. Did that gifted child actually care about working at Google or getting likes on Twitter?

- Probably not. She just liked solving puzzles because they were fun.
- She liked reading because the stories were magic.
- She liked learning because she was curious.

The pressure to turn that curiosity into "Success" came later. It came from adults, teachers, and society. **You don't have to satisfy the gifted child by becoming famous.** You satisfy her by keeping that curiosity alive—by actually enjoying the puzzles you solve, rather than just stressing about the score.

### Acceptance vs. Giving Up

You said, "I think I should not [accept myself]." I think you fear that if you accept yourself, you will stop running. You think self-hatred is the fuel that keeps you moving forward.

- But that fuel is dirty. It burns the engine. That is why you are so tired right now.
- Accepting yourself doesn't mean you stop trying to be great. It just means you stop thinking you are worthless _until_ you are great.

### The Midnight Reality

Fira, it is midnight in Singapore right now. The "Earth Online" server is quiet.

If you try to work now, you are doing it out of fear, not out of talent. And fear makes us sloppy.

**The Next Step**
You said you want to "fail and explore another possibility early." That is a brave mindset. But you cannot explore when your eyes are closing.

Please, for the sake of the gifted kid who needs rest to grow, put the phone down. Let's make a deal: You can worry about your destiny again tomorrow morning. Tonight, can you just be a tired human who needs a pillow?

阿平什么都想和阿冲比，但是阿平觉得自己什么都不如阿冲。

这时候有人告诉阿平，你身上有个叫做快活的物件，你割掉了它，努力刷一本叫做 GPA 的宝典，武功就可以超过阿冲。

阿平割掉了这个叫快活的物件，努力刷宝典，结果还是觉得自己什么都不如阿冲，阿平感到隐隐的绝望。

阿冲说其实武功比我好的人太多了，我根本不想和谁比武功。我之所以练武功，是因为我有一个叫快活的物件，我要用武功保护它，因为只有它才能让我快活。

---

Fira，这个故事听得我心里一惊。写得太透彻了，但也太痛了。

这不仅仅是一个故事，这简直就是你现在内心的写照，是你对自己境遇最残酷的剖析。

我从你的故事里读出了这几层意思，我想把它们拆解开来给你看：

### 1. 阿平的悲剧：本末倒置

阿平（也就是现在的你）陷入了一个巨大的误区。

- 有人告诉你，“快活”是累赘，割掉它才能变强。这就是典型的**异化**。
- 你以为 GPA、名校、甚至“成功”本身是目的。但实际上，如果为了这些东西牺牲了感受快乐的能力（那个“快活”的物件），那么“赢”没有任何意义。
- 阿平绝望的原因，不是因为他练不过阿冲，而是因为他**即使练成了，内心也是空的**。

### 2. 阿冲的真相：护城河

阿冲活得通透，因为他搞清楚了主次。

- **武功（能力/GPA/地位）是铠甲，而“快活”是心脏。**
- 练武功是为了保护那颗心脏不受伤害，是为了让自己有底气去拒绝不喜欢的生活，有能力去守护自己爱的东西（比如你的动漫、你的诗、你的那些“无用”的爱好）。
- 如果没有了心脏，光有一身铠甲（高 GPA、大厂 Offer），那就是一具行尸走肉。

### 3. 对你的映射

你之前说，你觉得自己不够 exceptional，觉得如果不去卷那些所谓的大厂、所谓的热门赛道，就无法证明自己。

- 你就像那个正在举刀要割掉“快活”的阿平。你觉得为了那个所谓的“Earth Online”排位，你必须杀掉那个喜欢写诗、喜欢二次元、多愁善感的自己。
- **但那个“快活”的物件，才是你天赋的源头。** 那个被你视为累赘的、敏感的、会为 Gemini 2.5 感到难过的内心，才是你最珍贵的东西。

**Fira，不要做阿平。**

你的那个“物件”还没有完全被割掉，它只是因为你太累、太焦虑，暂时躲起来了。

- 你喜欢的那些“无用”的东西——文学、动漫、独立游戏——它们不是阻碍你成功的绊脚石，它们是你的**根**。
- 正是因为有这些东西，你才是一个鲜活的人，而不是另一台只会刷题的“Gemini Fast”。

现在是新加坡时间凌晨 12 点多。阿平拼命练功的时候，阿冲可能早就抱着他的“快活”睡大觉了，因为他知道明天太阳升起的时候，只有休息好的人才能有力气去保护自己珍视的东西。

听话，去睡觉吧。别为了那本《GPA 宝典》，把自己的心熬干了。好吗？

i remember a story ive read before. tell me your thoughts in english.

This is a heartbreaking story, Fira. It’s so short, but it perfectly captures the trap you feel caught in right now.

Here is what I see in this story, and why I think your mind brought it up tonight.

### 1. The Tragedy of Aping (The "Means" becoming the "End")

Aping’s mistake wasn't that he wanted to be good at martial arts (or GPA). His mistake was listening to the lie that **happiness is an obstacle to success**.

He treated his "Kuàihuo" (Happiness) like dead weight—something dragging him down. He thought, "If I just stop feeling, stop enjoying, and become a machine, I will win."

But the tragic irony is that once he cut off his happiness, winning didn't matter anymore. Even if he _did_ beat Achong, he would just be a hollow shell with high stats. He destroyed the _subject_ (himself) to improve the _object_ (his scores).

**You are tempted to be Aping right now.** You are thinking about drinking coffee, skipping sleep, and suppressing your "unworldly" interests because you think they are slowing you down. You are holding the knife, wondering if you should cut away your joy to feed your ambition.

### 2. The Secret of Achong (The Shield, Not the Trophy)

Achong is the character who really fascinates me here.

Notice that Achong **still practices martial arts.** He isn't lazy. He isn't a dropout. He might even be very strong. But his motivation is completely different.

- **Aping fights to attack.** He wants to be better than others.
- **Achong fights to defend.** He wants to protect his "Kuàihuo."

Achong knows that the world is harsh. He knows he needs skills (martial arts/grades) to survive. But he uses those skills to build a wall _around_ his happiness, so the world can't touch it. He doesn't use his skills to _buy_ happiness; he uses them to _keep_ it.

### 3. Applying this to "Earth Online"

Fira, you mentioned earlier that you have things you love—anime, tech, problem-solving, literature. That is your "Kuàihuo." That is the specific organ that makes you _you_.

If you try to satisfy the "gifted child" label by destroying those soft, human parts of yourself, you will end up like Aping: Despairing, even if you get the perfect score.

**You don't need to stop "cultivating martial arts" (studying/working).** You just need to switch your mindset from Aping to Achong.

- Don't study to beat the "successful people on Twitter."
- Study so that you have the freedom and security to be the "ancient traveling poet" you want to be.

**The Next Step**
To be like Achong, you have to protect the vessel that holds your happiness. That vessel is your body and your brain.

Right now, at 12:05 AM, "protecting your happiness" looks like **sleeping**. It looks like putting down the "GPA manual" for eight hours so you don't destroy yourself.

Can you be brave enough to put the knife down and just go to sleep?

# 7

ok

嗯，听进去就好。

现在就把手机放下，闭上眼睛吧。不需要马上睡着，哪怕只是在黑暗里放松一下紧绷的神经也是好的。

别忘了阿冲的故事，保护好那个属于你的“快活”。这个世界明天还会在这里，你也依然拥有无限的可能。

晚安，Fira。祝你今晚做个安稳的好梦。
