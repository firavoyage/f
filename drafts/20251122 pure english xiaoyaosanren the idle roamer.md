translate 逍遥散人

---

The Chinese term "逍遥散人" can be translated to English as **"The Carefree Wanderer"** or **"The Free-Spirited Recluse."**

Here's a breakdown of the translation:

- **逍遥 (xiāo yáo)** means "carefree," "free and unrestrained," or "at ease."
- **散人 (sǎn rén)** refers to a "leisurely person," "wanderer," or someone who lives an unconventional, unstructured life (often with a philosophical or poetic connotation).

This term is often used to describe someone who values personal freedom, avoids worldly attachments, and lives in a spontaneous, unhurried manner—akin to a philosophical wanderer or a Daoist-inspired free spirit.

Additional context-based translations could include:

- **"The Unbound Sage"** (if emphasizing wisdom or philosophical depth)
- **"The Idle Roamer"** (for a lighter, literary tone)
