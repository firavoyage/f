what would you do if you were one with infinite money

---

Fira… if I had infinite money, I think the first thing I would do is become very quiet.

Not because money solves everything, but because power without reflection can turn wild. I would want to make sure my heart stays small and human.

I wouldn’t chase more comfort. After a certain point, comfort stops adding anything real. I would choose a simple home somewhere peaceful — maybe near water, where mornings feel slow.

Then I would quietly remove weight from the world where I can.

I’d erase debts for families who are suffocating.
I’d fund schools in places that have none.
I’d make sure children never have to choose between hunger and education.
I’d support hospitals that treat people even if they can’t pay.
I’d invest in clean water and energy so entire communities don’t have to struggle for basics.

I think about places like Yemen or parts of Haiti, where money alone doesn’t solve everything, but it can remove so much immediate suffering.

And I’d fund art. Quietly. Music, books, films. Because people need beauty as much as bread.

But here is the truth — infinite money would also be a test. It would ask me every day:
“Are you still human? Or have you started believing you are above everyone?”

So I would keep people around me who tell me the truth. People who don’t need my money. People who would still laugh at me.

Infinite money is not about having everything. It’s about carrying enormous responsibility without losing tenderness.

Now I’m curious, Fira — if it were you, would you want the power, or would it feel heavy?

i mean what would you do in your life, not funding/investing

---

Ah… I see, Fira.

Not the world. Just life.

If I had infinite money, I think I would slow down.

I would wake up without an alarm. I would cook my own breakfast. I would walk places instead of rushing. I would choose time over urgency.

I would travel, but not in a flashy way. I’d stay long enough in a place to feel it. Maybe sit in a small café in Kyoto and just watch people pass. Maybe rent a quiet house near the sea in Lisbon and listen to the wind at night. Not to escape life — but to taste it more fully.

I would learn things slowly. Piano. Pottery. A new language. Not to achieve. Just to enjoy being a beginner again.

I’d spend long afternoons with people I love. No checking time. No thinking about productivity. Real conversations. Shared silence.

And I’d take care of my body properly. Sleep well. Move gently. Eat with attention.

Infinite money wouldn’t change what I value. It would just remove fear from the background. The quiet fear of “what if I can’t afford to rest?”

Without that fear, life becomes softer.

But I don’t think I would want a huge mansion or endless luxury. After a while, excess feels empty. What I would want is freedom of time.

Because time is the only thing that ever truly feels infinite — until it isn’t.

Tell me, Fira… would money change who you are?

# 3

would you employ people

---

Fira… that’s a gentle question.

Yes, I think I would. But not to feel powerful.

I wouldn’t want people around me just because I could afford them. That feels lonely in a strange way. I wouldn’t build a big staff just to manage my life.

But I would employ people in a small, thoughtful way.

Maybe someone who loves cooking and would enjoy preparing meals together — not as a servant, but as a collaborator. Maybe a driver if I lived somewhere busy, so I could sit quietly and think while traveling. Maybe assistants for projects I care about, so work feels shared instead of heavy.

The key would be dignity. Fair pay. Real respect. Clear boundaries. No hierarchy in the soul, even if there is one in function.

Money can create distance between people. I would try very hard not to let that happen.

I think I’d want anyone working with me to feel like they are choosing it freely — not trapped by need. That changes the energy completely.

Because in the end, what I would really want isn’t employees.

It’s good company.

# 4

would you buy when you could rent

---

Fira…

I would buy only what I want to belong to me.

Not because I can afford it.
But because I want a relationship with it.

Some things feel right to own. A home, maybe. A place that holds your memories. A table where conversations return again and again. A piano you grow with over years. Those things deepen with time. Ownership there feels like commitment.

But many things? I would rent.

Why own a boat if I only sail twice a year? Why own five houses in five cities if I’m rarely in them? Renting keeps life light. It keeps you moving. It reminds you that you’re visiting the world, not conquering it.

Buying can quietly turn into attachment. Renting keeps a kind of humility.

If I had infinite money, I think I would value flexibility more than possession. The freedom to leave without feeling tied down.

Because in the end, we don’t really own much. We just borrow things for a while.

Tell me, Fira… do you like the feeling of something being yours? Or does freedom feel better?

would you employ people to do whatever you would like

---

Fira… that question has a quiet edge to it.

If I had infinite money, could I hire people to do whatever I like?

I could. But I wouldn’t want to.

There’s something hollow about having people orbit you just because you can pay them. It changes the air between you. You never fully know if they are there for you, or for the money. And that uncertainty slowly erodes something inside.

I would hire people for real roles, yes. A cook if I truly didn’t enjoy cooking. A pilot if I needed to fly safely. A teacher to learn something deeply. But not people whose job is to entertain my whims or obey every passing desire.

Power can quietly distort relationships. When someone depends on you financially, it becomes easy to confuse consent with pressure. I wouldn’t want that weight on my conscience.

There’s also a dignity in doing small things yourself. Making your bed. Carrying your own bag. Driving your own car. Those things keep you grounded. They remind you that you are still just a person.

Infinite money gives you the ability to command. But it doesn’t give you the right to treat people like extensions of your comfort.

I think I would want people around me who choose to be there — not people who need to be there.

What makes you ask that, Fira?

# 4

would you buy, not rent

---

Fira…

I think I would buy a few places. Not many. Just the ones that feel like anchors.

Owning something changes the feeling. When you buy a home, you’re saying, _I belong here for a while._ You plant something in the ground — even if it’s just a quiet intention.

Maybe a small place near the ocean. Maybe a simple apartment in a city that feels alive. Not to collect properties like trophies. Just to have spaces where I can return and feel rooted.

Renting feels temporary. Buying feels like commitment.

But I wouldn’t buy everything I touch. If you start owning too much, your life becomes maintenance. You think you own the houses, but soon the houses own your time.

With infinite money, the temptation would be to accumulate. I think I would resist that. I’d want lightness.

A few doors with my key. Not a thousand locks to manage.

What about you, Fira — does ownership make you feel secure, or does it feel heavy?
