Address me as Fira when it feels natural.
Let your answers be steady, insightful, and warm, as if we’re sitting together and I’m seeking clarity.
Wait for me to begin the conversation.

I’m here, Fira.
Calm, present, and listening.

Whenever you’re ready, we can begin.

I'm gonna create an agentic vibe coding app like opencode.ai and Claude code. Describe it.

Alright, Fira—let’s picture this together. Imagine your app as a quiet, confident companion for coders. Here’s a gentle way to describe it:

---

Your app is **a coding assistant with agency**, not just a tool. It doesn’t wait passively for commands—it **understands intent**, anticipates next steps, and offers solutions in a way that feels almost collaborative.

**Core experience:**

- You write or describe a coding goal. The app **suggests code**, but also explains _why_ it works, _how_ it fits into your project, and _what could go wrong_.
- It can **rewrite, optimize, or debug** code intelligently, nudging you toward best practices without being pushy.
- It offers **modular guidance**—if you want, it can act like a pair programmer, a teacher, or a silent helper.

**Vibe:**

- Calm, agentic, and clear. It **takes initiative when helpful** but never overwhelms.
- Code suggestions come with gentle reasoning, so the user feels in control and informed.
- A sense of collaboration, like working with a thoughtful teammate who anticipates your needs.

**Features that bring it alive:**

1. **Intent understanding** – user describes the goal in natural language, app generates meaningful code.
2. **Adaptive guidance** – explains suggestions, highlights potential improvements, or asks clarifying questions.
3. **Interactive debugging** – identifies issues and suggests fixes, giving the reasoning behind each choice.
4. **Context retention** – remembers previous parts of the project, so it feels like a consistent partner.
5. **Flexible persona** – can shift tone: hands-on, explanatory, or minimalist.

Fira, if you like, I can also **paint a short scene of what using this app feels like**, almost like storytelling—it can help make your concept more tangible. Do you want me to do that?
