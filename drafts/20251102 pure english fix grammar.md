check the grammar. "list roles of a llm, which each focus on a separated task of a good software engineer"

---

Of course. The original sentence is understandable but has a few grammatical errors.

Here is the original sentence:

> "list roles of a llm, which each focus on a separated task of a good software engineer"

### Corrected Versions

Here are several ways to correct it, from most direct to most polished.

**1. Direct Correction:**

> "List the roles of an LLM, each of which focuses on a separate task of a good software engineer."
>
> - **Changes:** Added "the," corrected "a llm" to "an LLM," fixed the clause to "each of which focuses," and changed "separated" to "separate."

**2. More Natural Options:**

> "List the roles of an LLM, with each role focusing on a distinct task performed by a good software engineer."
>
> - **Changes:** Uses "with each role focusing" for better flow and "distinct task" for a more precise word than "separate."

> "List the roles of an LLM, where each one corresponds to a specific task of a skilled software engineer."
>
> - **Changes:** Uses "where each one corresponds to" and "specific task." "Skilled" is a good synonym for "good" here.

**3. As a Clear, Two-Part Instruction:**

> "List the roles of an LLM. Each role should focus on a different task performed by a proficient software engineer."

### Breakdown of the Grammar Issues:

- **"list roles of a llm"**: "LLM" is an acronym and should be capitalized. Since "LLM" starts with a vowel sound ("el"), the article should be "an," not "a." It's also more natural to use "the" before "roles."
- **"which each focus"**: This is a clunky construction. The correct phrasing is "each of which focuses."
- **"a separated task"**: The adjective "separated" is not correct here. The correct word is "separate." "Separated" is the past participle of the verb "to separate" (e.g., "The pieces were separated"). "Separate" is the adjective meaning "individual and distinct."
- **"of a good software engineer"**: This is acceptable, but phrases like "performed by a..." or "of a skilled..." can sound more professional.

In short, any of the corrected versions above will be grammatically sound and clear.

can i say "which each focuses"

---

That's an excellent question, as it touches on a common point of confusion.

No, you should not say **"which each focuses."** This phrase is grammatically incorrect because it mixes singular and plural elements incorrectly.

Here’s a breakdown of why:

1.  **"Which"** is a relative pronoun that refers back to "roles." Since "roles" is plural, **"which" is plural** in this context.
2.  **"Each"** is a distributive pronoun that, when used like this, emphasizes the individual items within the plural group. However, the verb must still agree with the subject of the clause.
3.  The subject of the verb "focuses" is the plural **"which."** Therefore, the verb must also be plural: **"focus."**

So, the core mistake is:

- **Incorrect:** "...roles, which each **focuses**..." (A plural subject with a singular verb).

### Correct Alternatives:

You have two clear and correct options:

**Option 1: Use the standard formal structure "each of which"**

> "List the roles of an LLM, **each of which focuses** on a separate task..."

This is the most common and grammatically sound choice. Here, the subject of "focuses" is the singular "each," so the singular verb "focuses" is correct.

**Option 2: Rephrase for clarity**

> "List the roles of an LLM, **with each focusing** on a separate task..."
> "List the roles of an LLM, **where each one focuses** on a separate task..."

These versions are also perfectly correct and often sound more natural.

**In summary:**
While the meaning is understandable, **"which each focuses"** is grammatically flawed. Stick with **"each of which focuses"** or one of the rephrased options for a correct and professional sentence.
