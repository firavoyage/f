I’m here, Fira.
Calm, present, and listening.

Whenever you’re ready, we can begin.

# 1 (think arxiv)

can i upload an hello world pdf to arxiv

---

Yes, you _can_ upload a PDF to arXiv — but whether it will be **accepted** is a different matter.

Here’s the gentle truth, Fira.

arXiv is not just a file host. It is a **research archive**. Submissions are screened by human moderators to check that they meet basic scholarly standards.

A simple _“Hello World”_ PDF, by itself, would almost certainly be **rejected** because:

- It does not present original research, results, or insight
- It lacks scientific or scholarly content
- It does not fit arXiv’s purpose as a research repository

arXiv is meant for:

- Research papers
- Technical reports
- Substantial surveys or theoretical work
- Contributions that engage with an academic field

Even very short papers can be accepted — but they still need **real intellectual content**: an idea, a method, an argument, or a result.

There’s another important detail:
Most arXiv categories require **endorsement** from an existing arXiv author if you are a first-time submitter. A trivial submission would not receive endorsement.

So, in practice:

- You can technically upload a PDF
- A “Hello World” paper will not pass moderation
- It will not appear publicly on arXiv

If your deeper question is _“Where can I freely upload a simple PDF or experiment?”_, better places might be:

- GitHub (with a README or PDF)
- Zenodo
- OSF (Open Science Framework)
- Your personal website

If you want, you can tell me what’s _behind_ this question — curiosity, testing the system, learning academic publishing, or something more playful — and I’ll meet you there, gently and honestly.

how to upload on arxiv

---

Alright, Fira. Let’s walk through it calmly, step by step — no rush.

### 1. Create an arXiv account

Go to arXiv and register for an account.
You’ll need:

- An email address
- Basic personal information

After registering, you’ll confirm your email and be able to log in.

### 2. Get endorsed (if you’re new)

If this is your **first submission**, arXiv will ask for an **endorsement** in the subject area you’re submitting to.

This means:

- Another arXiv author, active in that field, confirms your work fits the category
- You request endorsement through the arXiv system
- This step can take some time, and approval isn’t guaranteed

Some categories are stricter than others.

### 3. Prepare your paper

arXiv prefers **LaTeX source files**, not just a PDF.

You usually upload:

- A main `.tex` file
- Any figures (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.)
- A bibliography file (`.bib`), if used

arXiv will generate the PDF itself.

You _can_ upload a PDF-only submission in limited cases, but it’s discouraged and more likely to run into problems.

### 4. Start a new submission

Once logged in:

- Click **“Start New Submission”**
- Choose the appropriate **subject category**
- Fill in metadata:

  - Title
  - Authors
  - Abstract
  - Comments (optional)

Take your time here — this is what readers first see.

### 5. Upload files

Upload your LaTeX source and any supporting files.
arXiv will compile them and show you a preview.

If there are errors, you’ll be asked to fix them before continuing.

### 6. Review and submit

Before final submission:

- Check the compiled PDF carefully
- Confirm the metadata
- Agree to arXiv’s submission terms

Once you submit:

- The paper goes into **moderation**
- Moderators check scope and basic quality
- This is not peer review, but it is a real filter

If accepted, your paper appears publicly, usually within a day or two.

---

### A gentle reality check

Uploading to arXiv is not about pushing a button.
It’s about **joining an academic conversation**.

If your work isn’t ready yet, that’s okay. Many good ideas need time to grow.

If you’d like, you can tell me:

- What kind of work you’re thinking of uploading
- Or whether you’re just exploring how arXiv works

We can take the next step together, slowly and clearly.

# 3 (find arxiv alternatives)

i dont think i could get an endorsement with a hello world string. where could i publish it. i mean somewhere for academic papers, not github.

---

That’s a very reasonable instinct, Fira.
You’re seeing the boundary clearly.

If what you have is _intentionally minimal_ — a “Hello World”–level artifact — then the key question becomes:

> _Is there an academic-adjacent place that allows publication without pretending it’s research?_

Yes. There are a few honest options. Each serves a slightly different purpose.

---

### 1. **Zenodo** (closest fit, academically respected)

Zenodo is run by CERN and OpenAIRE.

- Accepts PDFs, datasets, code, even tiny artifacts
- **No endorsement** required
- Assigns a **DOI** (this matters academically)
- Widely accepted as a _citable research object_

It does **not** judge novelty or depth.
It simply archives.

This is often where people put:

- Negative results
- Small notes
- Proofs of concept
- Minimal examples

If your goal is _“I want this to exist, be citable, and be honest”_, Zenodo is probably the best answer.

---

### 2. **OSF (Open Science Framework)**

OSF is more process-oriented.

- You can upload a paper or preprint
- No endorsement
- Emphasizes transparency and openness
- Used by real researchers

It feels academic, but less formal than arXiv.

Good if your “Hello World” is part of a learning trail or a larger exploration.

---

### 3. **Figshare**

Figshare sits between academia and archiving.

- Accepts papers and small research outputs
- Provides DOIs
- Used by universities and journals

It’s less theoretical than arXiv, more about _making things available_.

---

### 4. **HAL (if you have institutional ties)**

HAL is a French open archive used by universities.

- Academic tone
- Some moderation
- More flexible than arXiv

But it often expects an institutional affiliation.

---

### A quiet truth

arXiv is about _conversation_.
Zenodo, OSF, and Figshare are about _existence_.

There’s no shame in choosing existence.

In fact, being honest — _“this is minimal, and that is the point”_ — is a kind of integrity that academia often lacks.

If you want, tell me:

- **Why** you want to publish this
  (marking a beginning, making a philosophical point, learning the system, or something else)

That reason matters more than the venue.

# 4 (evaluate zenodo)

how is zenodo received

---

Zenodo is received **quietly well**, Fira — not celebrated, not dismissed.
It sits in a steady, respectable middle ground.

Here’s the clear picture.

Zenodo is **taken seriously as an archive**, not as a badge of prestige.

In academic culture, that distinction matters.

---

### How researchers see Zenodo

Most researchers understand Zenodo as:

- A **legitimate, stable repository**
- Backed by **CERN**
- Integrated with **OpenAIRE** and European research infrastructure
- A place that provides **DOIs** and long-term preservation

So when someone sees a Zenodo link, they usually think:

> “This exists, it’s archived properly, and I can cite it.”

They do **not** assume:

- Peer review
- High impact
- Prestige or selectivity

And that’s okay — Zenodo never claims those things.

---

### In practice

Zenodo is commonly used for:

- Supplementary papers
- Technical notes
- Minimal or exploratory work
- Software papers
- Datasets
- Early ideas that don’t fit journals or arXiv

Many **serious papers** cite Zenodo records without hesitation.

What matters is **how you frame the work**, not the platform itself.

---

### What Zenodo does _not_ give you

It won’t:

- Carry academic status by itself
- Impress hiring committees on its own
- Substitute for peer-reviewed publication

No one will say, “Oh wow, Zenodo!”
But no one will say, “This is illegitimate,” either.

That neutrality is its strength.

---

### The quiet advantage

Zenodo lets you say:

> “I am not inflating this.
> I am making it available.
> That is all.”

For something intentionally minimal — like a “Hello World” artifact — that honesty actually _lands better_ than forcing it into a research venue.

---

If you want, we can:

- Decide how to **describe** the work so it’s clear and clean
- Choose the right **metadata and keywords**
- Or talk about whether your goal is **record-keeping, signaling, or reflection**

We can take it slowly.

# 5 (evaluate arxiv on the narrow fields)

seems arxiv only accepts science and tech fields

---

Yes — that’s essentially true, Fira.

arXiv is **deliberately narrow**.

It accepts work only in specific **science and technical fields**, mainly:

- Physics
- Mathematics
- Computer science
- Statistics
- Quantitative biology
- Quantitative finance
- Electrical engineering / systems science
- Economics (limited, technical)

What ties these together is not “science” in a broad sense, but a **shared technical style**:
formal structure, equations, models, proofs, or computational methods.

---

### What arXiv does _not_ accept

arXiv is generally **not** for:

- Philosophy
- Humanities
- Art, literature, or essays
- Conceptual or reflective writing
- Minimal or symbolic gestures (like a pure “Hello World”)

Even if something is thoughtful or meaningful, if it doesn’t clearly belong to a technical research tradition, it won’t pass moderation.

arXiv’s role is not _expression_.
It’s _infrastructure for specific disciplines_.

---

### The deeper pattern

Think of it this way:

- **arXiv** = ongoing technical conversation
- **Zenodo / OSF / Figshare** = archival memory

arXiv asks:

> “Does this advance a technical field?”

Zenodo asks:

> “Should this exist, be cited, and remain accessible?”

They answer different human needs.

---

You’re not missing anything.
You’re simply standing at the edge of arXiv’s map and noticing where it ends.

If you’d like, we can talk about:

- Where **non-technical academic work** lives
- Or how to frame something minimal so it’s _honest_ rather than awkward

We can sit with the question a bit longer.

# 6 (find arxiv alternatives for non s&t)

then where for non s&t

---

That’s a good, quiet question, Fira.
And the answer is less tidy than arXiv — but it _does_ exist.

For **non–science & technology work**, there is no single arXiv-equivalent.
Instead, there are a few _gentler, more plural_ homes.

Let me lay them out clearly.

---

### 1. **Humanities Commons** (closest cultural match)

This is part of the nonprofit **Knowledge Futures Group**.

- Built specifically for **humanities and social theory**
- Accepts essays, notes, preprints, fragments
- No endorsement system
- Scholars actually browse and cite it

It feels like:

> “A shared study room for humanities thinkers.”

If your work is reflective, philosophical, or conceptual, this is often the _best-fit_ space.

---

### 2. **SSRN** (for social sciences, theory, law, philosophy-adjacent work)

SSRN is older and well-known.

- Used heavily in law, economics, political theory
- Accepts working papers and drafts
- Moderated, but broad
- Not limited to experiments or equations

It’s more formal than Zenodo, less rigid than journals.

---

### 3. **Zenodo** (again — because it really is cross-disciplinary)

Zenodo doesn’t care _what_ field you’re in.

That means:

- Essays
- Conceptual notes
- Minimal artifacts
- Meta-academic reflections

If you tag and describe it well, it sits comfortably alongside humanities work.

Zenodo is often the **neutral ground** when no field-specific archive exists.

---

### 4. **OSF Preprints (Humanities & Social Sciences)**

OSF hosts multiple preprint servers.

Some are explicitly non-technical:

- SocArXiv
- PsyArXiv
- LawArXiv

They don’t demand novelty — just seriousness.

---

### 5. **Institutional repositories**

Many universities host open repositories.

If you have any academic affiliation at all (even past):

- You may be able to upload essays or notes
- These are indexed and persistent

They’re quiet, but real.

---

### A gentle truth

Humanities and reflective work live differently.

They don’t gather in one loud plaza like arXiv.
They live in **libraries, footnotes, and margins**.

That doesn’t make them lesser.
It makes them slower.

---

If you want, tell me:

- Whether your work is **philosophical, literary, reflective, or symbolic**
- Or whether the “Hello World” is meant as a _gesture_ rather than content

Where something belongs depends on _what kind of voice it’s using_.
