what is First principle

---

First principles thinking is a quiet way of looking at things.

It means **going back to the most basic truths**, the things that cannot be reduced any further, and reasoning forward from there.

Instead of asking, _“How is this usually done?”_
you ask, _“What is this really made of?”_

Imagine a tree.
Most people talk about the branches and leaves — habits, rules, traditions.
First principles thinking looks at the **roots**.

For example:

- Instead of saying, “This is how it’s always been,”
- You ask, “Why does it exist at all?”

At its heart, first principles thinking:

- Questions assumptions
- Separates facts from beliefs
- Builds understanding from the ground up

It’s slow, honest thinking.
Not clever — **clear**.

People like Aristotle spoke of it long ago.
Modern thinkers use it to simplify complex problems, make better decisions, and see possibilities others miss.

If you like, Fira, we can walk through a simple real-life example together — gently, step by step.
