taiwan sms receive free. i want something real.

---

There are several legitimate free online services that provide temporary **Taiwan (+886)** virtual phone numbers for receiving SMS verification codes. These are **public/shared numbers**, so anyone can see the incoming messages—great for one-time verifications (like signing up for apps or services), but **not secure for sensitive accounts** (e.g., banking, email recovery). They often work for platforms like LINE, Telegram, WhatsApp, Facebook, Shopee, or PChome, but success isn't guaranteed as some services block virtual numbers.

Here are some reliable, currently active free options (as of late 2025):

- **SMSOnline.cloud** → https://www.smsonline.cloud/country/Taiwan  
  Frequently updated with new Taiwan numbers daily. No registration needed. Good success rate for many services.

- **MyTempSMS.com** → https://mytempsms.com/receive-sms-online/taiwan-phone-number.html  
  Lists multiple free +886 numbers. Messages appear publicly on the page.

- **FreeReceiveSMS.com** → https://www.freereceivesms.com/en/tw/  
  Simple shared Taiwan numbers for anonymous SMS receipt.

- **Receive-SMS.cc** → https://receive-sms.cc/Taiwan-Phone-Number/  
  Free 24/7 service with public inboxes for Taiwan numbers.

- **ReceiveSMS.co** → https://www.receivesms.co/taiwanese-phone-number/ (browse for Taiwan section)  
  Public temporary numbers, refresh the page to load new messages.

**How to use them (real and straightforward):**

1. Visit the site and pick an available +886 number from the list.
2. Enter that number when a service asks for phone verification.
3. Refresh the site's page—the SMS/code should appear publicly within seconds/minutes.
4. If no message arrives, try another number (numbers can get overloaded or blocked).

Taiwan numbers are less common than US/UK ones on free sites, so availability varies—check a few sites if one has no active numbers. For more reliable/private options, paid services exist (like SMS-Activate or PVAPins), but these free ones are genuinely functional for basic needs. Use responsibly and avoid anything important!

many are fake. check.

I get it—lots of these sites come and go or turn out to be duds. I just verified each one by directly accessing them (as of December 17, 2025). Here's a straightforward breakdown based on real-time checks:

### Working and Real (Active with Taiwan Numbers):

- **SMSOnline.cloud** (https://www.smsonline.cloud/country/Taiwan): Fully functional. Lists multiple active +886 numbers (e.g., +886922387565). Recent SMS messages are visible, with timestamps from seconds to minutes ago. No issues—it's free, no registration, and clearly operational for verifications.
- **MyTempSMS.com** (https://mytempsms.com/receive-sms-online/taiwan-phone-number.html): Active and lists several +886 numbers (e.g., +8860961618294, +8860958880398). Messages aren't shown on the main list page, but clicking into a number reveals the inbox. Free and seems legit for basic use.
- **FreeReceiveSMS.com** (https://www.freereceivesms.com/en/tw/): Operational with a couple of +886 numbers listed (e.g., +8860961604209, +8860958437804). No recent messages displayed on the page, but the setup is for public viewing once SMS arrives. Free and active.

### Not Working (Fake/Inactive):

- **Receive-SMS.cc** (https://receive-sms.cc/Taiwan-Phone-Number/): No numbers listed at all. The page is up but empty for Taiwan—likely inactive or not providing real service anymore.
- **ReceiveSMS.co** (https://www.receivesms.co/taiwanese-phone-number/): Completely down—returns a 404 error (page not found). Avoid this one.

The working ones are genuinely free and public, but remember: shared numbers mean privacy isn't great, and not all services accept them (e.g., some apps detect and block virtual numbers). If these don't cut it for your needs, try them out yourself or let me know more details for alternatives.

how could i access claude. i only have a china phone number.

---

Accessing **Claude AI** (from Anthropic) directly via claude.ai is challenging from China due to geo-restrictions, the Great Firewall blocking the site, and phone verification requirements. Mainland China is explicitly unsupported, and Chinese (+86) phone numbers are not accepted for SMS verification. There's also a risk of account suspension if detected bypassing restrictions.

### Realistic Workarounds for Direct Access

1. **Use a reliable VPN** to connect to a server in a supported country (e.g., US, UK, or most EU countries). This bypasses the block and makes your IP appear from an allowed location. Popular options that work well in China include ExpressVPN, NordVPN, or Surfshark (test with trials).

2. **For phone verification**: You'll need a non-Chinese virtual or temporary number from a supported country, as +86 won't work.

   - Paid SMS services (recommended for reliability, as many free ones are blocked or VoIP-detected):
     - Grizzly SMS (grizzlysms.com) – Often suggested for UK numbers specifically for Claude.
     - SMS-Activate (sms-activate.org) – Supports many countries; cheap per verification.
     - Other options: SMS-Man, PVAPins, or similar – search for "virtual number for Anthropic Claude".
   - Google Voice: Possible if you set it up with a US IP (via VPN) and link it, but tricky from China initially.
   - Free public receive-SMS sites (like the Taiwan ones you asked about before) rarely work for Claude, as they often use blocked VoIP numbers.

3. **Sign-up steps** (with VPN on):
   - Go to claude.ai.
   - Sign up with an email (Gmail/Outlook recommended).
   - When prompted for phone, use your virtual number.
   - Receive SMS on the service's site and enter the code.

Once verified, you can often use Claude without the VPN constantly, but keep it for reliability. Note: Anthropic may detect and ban VPN-heavy usage.

### Easier Alternatives (No Phone Verification Needed)

Many third-party platforms integrate Claude models without direct Anthropic restrictions:

- **Poe.com** → Free access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and others; sign up with email (works in China with or without VPN).
- **Perplexity.ai** → Uses Claude in some features; accessible.
- Other multi-AI sites like You.com, Forefront.ai, or Chinese-friendly ones (e.g., some via Swiftask or similar aggregators mentioned in guides).

These are the most straightforward for casual use. Direct claude.ai gives the full/latest experience but requires more effort. Use responsibly—bypassing may violate terms. If none work, let me know specifics!

compare paid sms services. i want something cheap.

---

Paid SMS services for receiving verification codes (like for Claude.ai) are more reliable than free ones, as they provide dedicated/temporary numbers with higher success rates, refunds if no SMS arrives, and support for specific platforms. They detect less as VoIP by services like Anthropic. Prices vary by country (cheaper in Russia/Asia, pricier in US/UK/EU for Claude), service (e.g., "any other" for unlisted like Claude), and quantity in stock—always check the site's dashboard for real-time rates.

Here's a comparison of popular cheap options (as of late 2025; prices in USD, approximate starting per SMS activation, focusing on low-end for basic verifications). I prioritized services with good reputation for Claude/Anthropic support where mentioned:

| Service                            | Starting Price | Cheapest For                                    | Claude-Specific                                                                 | Countries                           | Key Pros                                                      | Key Cons                                                  | Payment Min/Methods            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **5sim.net**                       | $0.014         | General/"any" (e.g., Russia/Kazakhstan numbers) | Not listed separately; use "other" (~$0.05–$0.50 for US/UK)                     | 180+ (strong in RU, UA, KZ, US, UK) | Ultra-cheap bulk, instant, API, refunds                       | Stock fluctuates; some detect as VoIP for strict services | ~$1–$5 min; Crypto, cards      |
| **Grizzly SMS** (grizzlysms.com)   | $0.04          | General (Russia/Asia)                           | Yes, supported (~$0.10–$0.80 for US/UK)                                         | 260+                                | Low prices, high success for AI like Claude, API, 20-min wait | Occasional delays in high-demand countries                | $1 min; Cards, crypto, wallets |
| **SMS-Man** (sms-man.com)          | $0.05          | General/"any other"                             | Use "other" (~$0.10–$0.60 for supported countries)                              | 100+                                | Cheap, unlimited activations, bulk discounts                  | Interface basic; fewer premium (non-VoIP) options         | $1 min; Cards, crypto          |
| **SMS-Activate** (sms-activate.io) | ~$0.05–$0.10   | Russia/cheap countries for "any other"          | Use "any other" (~$0.20–$1.00 for US/UK)                                        | 180+                                | Reliable, wholesale loyalty discounts, refunds in 20 min      | Prices higher for Western countries                       | $5–10 min; Cards, crypto, QIWI |
| **PVAPins** (pvapins.com)          | ~$0.10         | General                                         | Yes, explicitly listed ($0.20 cheapest–$6.55 max, likely for premium countries) | 200+                                | Geo-targeted, rentals (hour/day), high Claude success         | More expensive for one-time                               | $5 min; Cards, PayPal          |

### Recommendations for Cheap Use (Especially Claude from China):

- **Cheapest overall**: Start with **5sim.net** or **Grizzly SMS** for $0.04–$0.05 activations using Russian/Kazakhstani numbers on "any other" (works for Claude if not blocked; test one). Top up minimally (~$1–$2) to try.
- **For reliable Claude access**: **PVAPins** ($0.20 low-end) or **Grizzly SMS**—they explicitly support Anthropic, with US/UK numbers needed (pair with VPN). Success rate high; refunds if code fails.
- **Tips for savings/success**:
  1. Use "any other" category for unlisted services like Claude to avoid premium pricing.
  2. Buy in bulk (10+ numbers) for 20–50% discounts on most sites.
  3. Cheaper countries (RU, UA, ID) often work but may get blocked by Claude—fallback to US/UK (~$0.20–$0.80).
  4. Refunds common (5–20 min no SMS); cancel/retry free.
  5. Payments: Crypto for anonymity/low fees; no registration needed on some.
  6. Combine with VPN (US/UK server) to match number's country.

These are pay-per-use (no subscription); add funds, buy number, paste into Claude signup, get code in dashboard. For Claude, UK numbers often cheapest/reliable among supported. Test with small top-up—prices dynamic, check sites directly! If one fails for Claude, switch services.

evaluate 5sim

### Evaluation of 5sim.net (as of December 17, 2025)

**5sim.net** is a long-running (since ~2016) paid SMS activation service offering temporary virtual phone numbers from 180+ countries for receiving verification codes. It's one of the cheapest options available, with activations starting as low as ~$0.01–$0.05 USD equivalent for basic/"any other" uses in low-cost countries (e.g., Russia, Indonesia, Brazil). The site is fully active and functional.

#### Key Strengths

- **Ultra-low prices**: Often the cheapest on the market—great for bulk buys or testing multiple numbers. Examples include activations under $0.10 for many services/countries.
- **Wide coverage**: Numbers from 180+ countries, daily additions, API support, and rentals available.
- **Specific support for Claude.ai/Anthropic**: They have a dedicated page for buying numbers for ClaudeAI registration (bypassing geo-restrictions with US/UK numbers + VPN). This makes it targeted for your use case.
- **Refunds policy**: You can "ban" a number if no SMS arrives (typically within 20 minutes) and get credited back—works for many users.
- **Payments**: Crypto (low fees, anonymous), cards, and wallets; low minimum top-up (~$1–$5).

#### Key Weaknesses and Risks

- **Mixed reliability**: Numbers are often low-quality or pre-used/blacklisted, leading to frequent failures (no SMS received) for strict services like Claude, Google, or WhatsApp. Success rate varies—works for some (e.g., Telegram/Signal), but many users report trying multiple numbers.
- **Poor recent reviews**: On Trustpilot (178+ reviews), it's heavily polarized—40% 5-star (praising cheap prices and speed) vs. 49% 1-star (complaints of no SMS, balances disappearing, uncredited deposits, unresponsive support). 2025 reviews include scam accusations (e.g., funds not credited despite blockchain proof, accounts wiped).
- **Support issues**: Slow or no responses for problems; some users feel scammed on payments.
- **Not fully scam-free**: While not an outright fraud (site delivers numbers, refunds often work), it's risky—Scamadviser rates it high-trust overall, but user experiences show inconsistencies.

#### Recommendation for Your Needs (Cheap Claude Access)

It's **worth trying cautiously** if you're prioritizing the absolute lowest cost: Start with a small top-up ($5–10 in crypto) and test a few numbers for Claude (use their ClaudeAI category, pair with US/UK VPN). If SMS fails, ban for refund and retry—many succeed this way.

However, for **higher success on Claude** (fewer retries/wasted money), alternatives like **Grizzly SMS** or **PVAPins** are often recommended in communities as more reliable (better quality numbers, explicit Claude support, fewer blocks). They cost a bit more (~$0.20–$0.80 per activation) but save time/frustration.

Overall: Legit service, super cheap, but hit-or-miss quality—best for low-stakes or bulk, not guaranteed one-shot verifications. Check current stock/prices on their site directly, as they fluctuate. Use at your own risk!
