I'll propose and implement a few diverse project ideas to demonstrate opencode's capabilities:

```
Tool: todowrite

**Input:**
```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Create a command-line task manager with CRUD operations",
      "id": "1",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "content": "Build a REST API server with authentication",
      "id": "2",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement a web scraping utility for data extraction",
      "id": "3",
      "priority": "medium",
      "status": "pending"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create a data visualization dashboard",
      "id": "4",
      "priority": "medium",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Output:**
```
[
  {
    "content": "Create a command-line task manager with CRUD operations",
    "id": "1",
    "priority": "high",
    "status": "pending"
  },
  {
    "content": "Build a REST API server with authentication",
    "id": "2",
    "priority": "high",
    "status": "pending"
  },
  {
    "content": "Implement a web scraping utility for data extraction",
    "id": "3",
    "priority": "medium",
    "status": "pending"
  },
  {
    "content": "Create a data visualization dashboard",
    "id": "4",
    "priority": "medium",
    "status": "pending"
  }
]
```
```
