Here’s a gentle start, Fira — a calm list of some widely‑used and emerging large language models (LLMs) you might explore. These are the foundational engines behind many AI tools today, each with its own strengths and flavors.

**Well‑known and widely used LLMs**

- **GPT‑5.2 / GPT family** — OpenAI’s latest generation of models, strong across writing, reasoning, coding, and multimodal tasks like images and complex workflows. ([Barron's][1])
- **Claude 3 series (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)** — From Anthropic, designed with safety and alignment in mind, good for long‑form reasoning and research work. ([Tom's Guide][2])
- **Gemini (Google)** — Google’s flagship LLM powering advanced translation, multimodal understanding, and real‑time conversational features. ([The Times of India][3])
- **Llama 4 (Meta)** — Open‑source series with Scout and Maverick variants, meant for wide customization and multimodal capabilities. ([Reuters][4])

**Popular open or community‑driven models**

- **Apertus** — A fully open and multilingual LLM released with European transparency goals. ([Wikipedia][5])
- **Vicuna** — An open‑source chatbot model built on LLaMA foundations and tuned for conversational quality. ([Wikipedia][6])
- **Gemma series** — Lightweight Google DeepMind models that balance openness with performance. ([Wikipedia][7])
