design some cards for shadowverse world beyond

---

Of course! Designing cards for a hypothetical new Shadowverse expansion, "World Beyond," is a fantastic idea. Let's assume this expansion explores uncharted realms, forgotten dimensions, and the edges of reality, introducing new mechanics and supporting older archetypes.

Here are some card designs for **Shadowverse: World Beyond**, complete with flavor text and potential strategic roles.

---

### **New Keyword: Revelation**

**Reveal** the bottom card of your deck. If it meets a specific condition, activate a powerful effect. This keyword encourages deck manipulation and rewards knowing your deck's structure.

---

### **Neutral Cards**

**1. Dimensional Pilgrim**

- **Cost:** 2 PP
- **Type:** Follower
- **Rarity:** Bronze
- **Stats:** 2/2 (2 Attack / 2 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Fanfare: Revelation.** If the revealed card is a follower with a cost of 2 or less, draw it.
- **Flavor Text:** _"Every path is worth walking, for even the smallest detour can lead to a world-altering discovery."_

- **Design Notes:** A solid early-game tool for decks that want to maintain hand advantage and thin their deck. Enables smooth plays and sets up future Revelation effects.

**2. The Horizon's Echo**

- **Cost:** 5 PP
- **Type:** Follower
- **Rarity:** Gold
- **Stats:** 4/5 (4 Attack / 5 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Fanfare: Revelation.** If the revealed card is a spell, reduce its cost by 2.
  - **Necromancy (6):** Then, put a copy of that spell into your hand.
- **Flavor Text:** _A whisper from a future that never was, a spell cast in a world that never will be. Its power is real, nonetheless._

- **Design Notes:** A powerful value engine for control or combo decks, particularly in Shadowcraft. It helps cycle through the deck and can generate immense value with high-cost spells.

---

### **Class-Specific Cards**

#### **Forestcraft**

_Theme: Aggressive "Lone Explorer" tokens and bounce synergy._

**3. Lost in the Thicket**

- **Cost:** 1 PP
- **Type:** Spell
- **Rarity:** Bronze
- **Effect:** Summon a **Wandering Wisp**.
  - **If 2 other cards were played this turn,** also draw a card.
- **Flavor Text:** _"Don't worry, they said. The path is clear, they said. Now I'm surrounded by glowing trees and the eyes of things that don't have faces."_

- **Design Notes:** A flexible 1-drop that fuels fairies, enables combo count, and can replace itself. Perfect for the classic Forest game plan.

**4. Kael, Realm-Walker**

- **Cost:** 7 PP
- **Type:** Follower (Legendary)
- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Stats:** 5/5 (5 Attack / 5 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Storm**
  - **Fanfare:** Return all other followers to their owners' hands. Then, summon a **Wandering Wisp** for each card returned.
- **Flavor Text:** _With a single step, he unravels the tapestry of reality. Armies become memories, and fortresses become figments._

- **Design Notes:** A massive board-clearing swing card that also sets up a wide board of tokens for a potential lethal push or a follow-up play. Fits Forest's disruptive and combo-heavy identity.

---

#### **Swordcraft**

_Theme: Officers that benefit from being "deployed" from the deck._

**5. Vanguard Scout**

- **Cost:** 3 PP
- **Type:** Follower (Officer)
- **Rarity:** Silver
- **Stats:** 3/3 (3 Attack / 3 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Rush**
  - **Revelation** (When this follower is revealed from your deck): Gain +1/+1 and **Storm**.
- **Flavor Text:** _"First in, last out. We don't need maps; we make the paths others will follow."_

- **Design Notes:** A versatile tool. Played from hand, it's a solid Rush follower. Revealed from the deck, it becomes a potent Storm threat, adding unexpected pressure.

**6. Amelia, Commander of the Final Front**

- **Cost:** 8 PP
- **Type:** Follower (Commander - Legendary)
- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Stats:** 6/7 (6 Attack / 7 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Fanfare:** Put a random Officer from your deck into your hand. It costs 0 until the end of your turn.
  - **Enhance (10):** Instead, put 3 random Officers from your deck into your hand. They cost 0 until the end of your turn.
- **Flavor Text:** _Her command extends beyond nations, beyond worlds. Where she leads, victory follows, no matter the reality._

- **Design Notes:** A massive value and tempo engine. The base effect is strong, but the Enhance (10) can end games on the spot by flooding the board with free, high-impact Officers.

---

#### **Runecraft**

_Theme: Spellboost and a new "Converge" sub-theme (benefits from having a wide variety of card costs in hand)._

**7. Erratic Glyph**

- **Cost:** 2 PP
- **Type:** Spell
- **Rarity:** Bronze
- **Effect:** Deal 2 damage to an enemy follower.
  - **Spellboost:** Deal 1 more damage.
  - **Converge:** If you have at least 4 different card costs in your hand, draw a card.
- **Flavor Text:** _Its shape defies geometry, its power defies physics. It is a perfect piece of an impossible whole._

- **Design Notes:** A flexible removal spell that rewards a diverse hand, encouraging a new playstyle alongside the classic Spellboost archetype.

**8. The Librarian of Lost Tomes**

- **Cost:** 4 PP
- **Type:** Follower
- **Rarity:** Gold
- **Stats:** 3/4 (3 Attack / 4 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Fanfare: Revelation.** If the revealed card is a spell, reduce its cost to 0.
  - **Earth Rite:** Then, cast that spell (targets chosen randomly).
- **Flavor Text:** _He tends to books that write themselves and scrolls that contain the screams of dead stars. He is, by all accounts, a very good librarian._

- **Design Notes:** A card that bridges Earth Rite and Spellboost/Revelation. It can generate incredible, unpredictable value, perfectly capturing Rune's high-risk, high-reward nature.

---

#### **Dragoncraft**

_Theme: Ramping into colossal "World-Ender" followers._

**9. Leyline Prospector**

- **Stats:** 2/3 (2 Attack / 3 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Fanfare:** Gain an empty play point orb.
  - **Overflow:** Draw a card.
- **Flavor Text:** _"This world's veins are rich with power. A shame it's dying... but it will fuel our journey to the next!"_

- **Design Notes:** A straightforward and efficient ramp tool that provides late-game value. Helps Dragon reach its powerful Overflow and high-cost cards faster.

**10. Aetherwyrm, the World-Serpent**

- **Cost:** 10 PP
- **Type:** Follower (Legendary)
- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Stats:** 8/10 (8 Attack / 10 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Storm**
  - **Ward**
  - **Fanfare:** Deal damage equal to the number of play point orbs you have to all other followers.
- **Flavor Text:** _It does not fly through the sky, but through the spaces between skies. Its arrival is not an invasion; it is an apocalypse._

- **Design Notes:** The ultimate payoff for a ramp deck. A huge, near-unstoppable finisher that clears the board while presenting a massive Ward/Storm threat.

---

#### **Shadowcraft**

_Theme: Necromancy and recycling followers from the bottom of the deck._

**11. Grave-Digger Apparition**

- **Cost:** 1 PP
- **Type:** Follower
- **Rarity:** Bronze
- **Stats:** 1/1 (1 Attack / 1 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Last Words:** Put a random follower from your cemetery into your deck. Then, **Revelation.** If the revealed card is a follower, gain a shadow for its cost.
- **Flavor Text:** _It doesn't dig graves so much as it digs memories from the soil, replaying the final moments of the dead for all eternity._

- **Design Notes:** A fantastic 1-drop that fuels shadows, recycles key Last Words followers, and synergizes with the new Revelation mechanic.

**12. Morvana, the Last Queen**

- **Cost:** 9 PP
- **Type:** Follower (Legendary)
- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Stats:** 7/7 (7 Attack / 7 Defense)
- **Effect:**
  - **Fanfare:** Destroy all other followers.
  - **Necromancy (20):** Then, summon a **Reborn Knight** for each follower destroyed. Give them **Storm**.
  - (Reborn Knight is a 3/3 Follower)
- **Flavor Text:** _Her kingdom fell to dust eons ago. Now, she wanders the multiverse, collecting the souls of the fallen to build a new one in her image._

- **Design Notes:** A game-ending board wipe that transitions into a massive lethal threat. Requires significant shadow investment, making it a powerful but balanced finisher for late-game Shadow.

These cards aim to introduce new strategic depth with the **Revelation** keyword while supporting and refreshing existing class identities. The "World Beyond" theme allows for epic, reality-bending flavor that fits Shadowverse's high-fantasy style perfectly.

design some cards for shadowverse world beyond

---

Based on the latest card pack "Heirs of the Omen" and developer insights, you can design compelling cards for _Shadowverse: Worlds Beyond_ by focusing on its established mechanics and new strategic layers like "Superior Evolution" . The table below summarizes key mechanics from the current environment to inspire your designs.

| **Mechanic / Concept**           | **Description**                                                                                        | **Appears In / Inspiration**                           |
| :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Faith"**                      | Builds up when using cards with selectable modes; unlocks powerful effects at high values .            | Nightmare (e.g., "混融的繼承者‧夏姆‧娜可亞")           |
| **"Omen"**                       | Provides a continuous "纹章" effect that deals damage each turn based on the number of seals .         | Bishop (e.g., "絕望的顯現‧瑪文")                       |
| **"Disdain"**                    | Triggers effects when a follower survives damage, leading to card draw or extra damage .               | Dragon (e.g., "烈絕的顯現‧嘉魯蜜兒")                   |
| **"New Order"**                  | Utilizes "New Order" amulets (White and Black) to turn card downsides into advantages .                | Vengeance (e.g., "破壞的繼承者‧阿克西雅")              |
| **"Treasure"**                   | Involves playing weak Treasure tokens and fusing them for powerful swing turns .                       | Royal Guard (e.g., "篡奪的繼承者‧辛士萊茲")            |
| **"Fated"**                      | Reduces a card's cost and grants an additional effect when played, but the effect is consumed .        | Witch (Neutral support, e.g., "涸絕的顯現‧吉魯涅莉婕") |
| **"Superior Evolution**          | A core new system; more impactful than regular evolution, with distinct "Superior Evolution" effects . | All Classes                                            |
| **Extra PP (Extra Play Points)** | A new rule that provides additional resources for more complex plays .                                 | All Classes                                            |

### 💡 Advanced Design Concepts

Once you're comfortable with the basic mechanics, you can explore these higher-level concepts to create more unique card designs.

- **Cross-Archetype Synergy**: Design cards that can support multiple deck archetypes within a single class. For example, a card for Vengeance that benefits both from the number of "New Order" amulets in play and the number of Artifacts that entered play this turn. This increases the card's versatility .
- **Resource Acceleration for Combo Decks**: The neutral card "試煉的石板" is a great example of a card that helps combo decks (like the "Satan" deck) find their key pieces faster. Consider designing cards that offer targeted deck searching or cost reduction for specific strategies .
- **The "Auto-Evolve" Mechanic**: While not new, this remains a powerful tool. As seen with "清澄的蒼藍‧坦忒菈," you can design cards that gain "0 EP Evolution" under certain conditions, providing significant tempo swings without consuming your valuable evolution points for the turn .
- **Unique Win Conditions**: For truly epic legendary cards, consider alternate win conditions like "絕大的顯現‧馬塞班恩." These designs are often complex and difficult to achieve, but they offer a unique and satisfying playstyle for control or combo players .

### 🎨 A Step-by-Step Card Design Example

Here is a practical process for creating a new card, using the "Disdain" mechanic as an example.

1.  **Choose a Core Mechanic**: Start with "Disdain," which rewards players for their followers surviving damage.
2.  **Define the Card's Role**: Design a Legendary Dragoncraft follower, "Scornfire Dragon," costing 7 PP with 5 Attack and 7 Defense.
3.  **Draft the Card Text**:
    - **Fanfare**: Deal 2 damage to all followers.
    - **Superior Evolution (3 EP)**: This follower gains **Storm** and **"During your turn, this follower can attack the enemy leader regardless of the enemy's field."**
    - **Disdain Effect**: Whenever an allied follower survives damage, subtract 1 from this card's cost (while in hand).
4.  **Refine the Design**:
    - The **Fanfare** synergizes with the "Disdain" archetype by pinging your own and the enemy's board.
    - The **Cost Reduction** from the "Disdain" effect helps you play this high-cost card earlier, creating a rewarding payoff for building your deck correctly.
    - The **Superior Evolution** effect provides a powerful, game-ending threat, consistent with Dragoncraft's high-impact, late-game style .

I hope these ideas help you start designing your own cards for _Shadowverse: Worlds Beyond_. What class or mechanic are you most interested in exploring? I can offer more specific ideas if you'd like.

design some cards for a new expansion in shadowverse world beyond

---

Based on the themes and mechanics of _Shadowverse: Worlds Beyond_, you can design new cards by drawing inspiration from recent expansions like "Heirs of the Omen" and the game's unique systems such as "超进化" (Superior Evolution) .

Here is a concept for a new expansion titled **"Echoes of the Ancestral Beasts"**, along with some sample card designs to help spark your creativity.

### 🎴 Expansion Concept: Echoes of the Ancestral Beasts

This expansion introduces the **"Manifestation"** mechanic. Followers with **Manifestation** have a powerful, optional effect that you can activate by paying its cost when you play them. If you choose not to activate it, the follower gains **"Storm"** on its next evolution (including Superior Evolution) .

### 💡 Sample Card Designs

| Pay 2 PP; Deal 3 damage to an enemy follower. If this is not activated, gains **"Storm"** on evolution.                                                   |
| **Soulweaver Aria**                                                                                                                                       | Nemesis | 5    | Follower | 4/5 (7/8)      | **[Fanfare]**       |
| Choose: Draw a card and gain "Faith"; or if you have at least 7 "Faith", draw 2 cards and reduce the cost of all "Manifestation" cards in your hand by 1. |
| **Ironwood Guardian**                                                                                                                                     | Forest  | 3    | Follower | 2/4 (5/7)      | **[Manifestation]** |
| Pay 1 Forest Plum; Summon a **Forest Plum**. If not activated, gains **"Storm"** on evolution.                                                            |
| **Royal Strategist, Klaus**                                                                                                                               | Royal   | 2    | Follower | 2/2 (4/4)      | **[Fanfare]**       |
| If at least 3 Treasure cards have been fused this match, draw a Treasure from your deck and gain an additional EP.                                        |
| **Ancestral Beast, Gamaru**                                                                                                                               | Neutral | 7    | Follower | 6/7 (9/10)     | **[Manifestation]** |
| Pay 3 PP; Gain +1/+1 for every PP spent this turn. If not activated, gains **"Storm"** on evolution.                                                      |

### ⚙️ Key Mechanics & Design Philosophy

When designing your cards, focusing on the game's core mechanics will make them feel authentic.

- **Leverage Class Identities**: Each class in _Shadowverse: Worlds Beyond_ has a distinct playstyle. Your card designs should reinforce these identities .

  - **Royal Guard**: Focus on synergistic strategies like fusing **Treasure** cards for powerful effects .
  - **Nemesis**: Utilize mechanics like **"Faith"** that grow in power as you meet certain conditions during the match .
  - **Dragon**: Can utilize the **"Manifestation"** mechanic to create flexible options, aligning with its adaptive playstyle .

- **Incorporate Core Systems**: The **"Superior Evolution"** system is central to the game. Designing cards with powerful evolution or Superior Evolution effects can create exciting moments. The **"Manifestation"** mechanic proposed above plays directly into this by offering a choice between an immediate effect or a enhanced evolution turn .

- **Create Meaningful Choices**: Many new cards introduce strategic decisions. For example, the **"Manifestation"** keyword forces a player to choose between a immediate impact and a future threat, which aligns well with the strategic depth of the game .

- **Build Around New Keywords**: Introducing a new keyword, like **"Manifestation"**, can define an expansion. It encourages new deck-building strategies and can be balanced across different costs and classes to ensure variety.

Hopefully, these ideas provide a solid starting point for your custom expansion.

If you have a favorite class or a specific mechanic you'd like to explore further, feel free to ask for more tailored card ideas.
