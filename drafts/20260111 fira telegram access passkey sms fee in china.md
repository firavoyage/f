did you hear 86 phone numbers have to pay a fee to receive sms on telegram. how to create a passkey.

---

Yes, Fira — I see the concern you’re talking about, and there’s _some truth mixed with confusion_ in what’s been circulating online about phone numbers and Telegram. Let’s sit with this gently and sort it out into simple, clear understanding. 🌿

---

### 🌙 What’s Happening With **+86 Numbers and SMS Fees**

Some people using **Chinese (+86) phone numbers** have seen a message in Telegram saying they must pay a small fee (about **$1.19 USD**) to receive the SMS verification code that Telegram sends when you try to register or log in. This comes from experiences shared online by users in forums and how‑to guides about this situation. ([LINUX DO][1])

That doesn’t mean every single +86 number must pay — it’s more like:
• Telegram seems to charge a **SMS sending cost** for certain regions where international SMS delivery is expensive. ([storytrain.info][2])
• That cost shows up during **the verification process** (the one where Telegram sends a code by SMS). ([LINUX DO][1])
• The idea is to reduce abuse (spam accounts) while covering the cost of sending messages internationally. ([storytrain.info][2])

So yes, some +86 users have seen this fee notice — it’s not just a rumor, but it’s not fully _universal official policy_ either: some people can bypass it with different setups like using a VPN, non‑mainland number, or a virtual number. ([LINUX DO][1])

---

### 🛠 How People Are Coping

Here are gentle, simple ways people try to get past that prompt:

✨ **Switch networks or use VPN:**
Sometimes when the app thinks you’re outside the high‑cost region, the SMS doesn’t show the fee message. ([LINUX DO][1])

✨ **Use a non‑mainland number or virtual number:**
Some folks use a number from another country — either a real SIM or a trusted _virtual number service_ — to get the verification SMS without the charge. ([storytrain.info][2])

✨ **Stay logged in on your device:**
Once your account is verified on your device, Telegram usually won’t ask SMS again unless you fully log out or reinstall. ([Turrit][3])

(There are also online SMS receiving services, but those are very hit‑and‑miss and sometimes not safe or reliable — gentle caution here.) ([SmmAcc][4])

---

### 🔑 What **Passkey** Means in Telegram

Now about **“passkeys”** — that’s a different, warm piece of clarity:

💛 A **passkey** is a secure way to _log in without needing SMS codes every time_. It uses built‑in device security — like your fingerprint, Face ID, or a PIN — instead of one‑time codes from a phone message. ([Telegram][5])

But, quietly and gently:
• Passkeys are an _additional option_ — **not a replacement** for having a phone number on your account yet. Telegram still needs your phone number _for account registration and association_. ([Telegram][5])
• Once your number is linked and you’ve enabled a passkey, you can log in more softly — without SMS every time. ([Telegram][5])

So that’s a hopeful path: we keep the number connected, but we _reduce our reliance on SMS codes once we’re logged in._ 🌼

---

### 🌼 How to Create a Passkey (Simple Steps)

Here’s the gentle, clear process — if your Telegram version supports it:

1. **Open Telegram.**
2. Go to **Settings** → **Privacy and Security**.
3. Look for a section labeled **Passkey** (or **Login Keys / Secure Login**). ([Telegram][5])
4. Tap **Create Passkey**.
5. You’ll confirm with your device lock (PIN, fingerprint, or Face ID).
6. Once set, your passkey will be stored securely — often synced via your phone’s password manager. ([Telegram][5])

This makes the next login feel lighter — like entering your cozy home without fishing for SMS codes every time.

how to create a passkey.

---

Of course, Fira — here’s a **gentle and clear guide** to creating a _passkey_ in Telegram. This is a new feature that lets you log in using your **device’s PIN, fingerprint, or Face ID** instead of needing repeated SMS codes. ([Telegram][1])

---

### 🌿 What a Passkey Is

A **passkey** is a secure login key stored on your phone or in your password manager — it lets you sign in with a touch or a look, without asking for an SMS code every time. ([Telegram][1])

---

### 🌼 How to Create a Passkey in Telegram

Here’s the step‑by‑step flow:

1. **Open Telegram** on your iPhone, Android, or supported desktop. ([Telegram][1])
2. Tap **Settings** (usually the gear icon). ([9to5Mac][2])
3. Find **Privacy and Security.** ([9to5Mac][2])
4. Look for **Passkeys** in that menu. ([9to5Mac][2])
5. Tap **Create Passkey** (or **Add Passkey**). ([Telegram][1])
6. Your phone will ask you to **confirm with your fingerprint, Face ID, or device PIN** — do that. ([9to5Mac][2])
7. Once done, Telegram will store a secure key on your device (and you might choose to sync it with a password manager like iCloud or Google). ([Telegram][1])

---

### 🌷 After It’s Created

✨ When you log in on a new device or re‑open Telegram, it can offer “**Log in with Passkey**” instead of sending a code. ([9to5Mac][2])

✨ You’ll confirm with your face, fingerprint, or PIN — quick and warm, like unlocking your door. ([9to5Mac][2])

✨ You **still need an active phone number** tied to your account for recovery and setup — passkeys don’t replace that entirely. ([9to5Mac][2])

---

### 🌱 A Little Note

This feature is new and slowly rolling out, so if you don’t see it yet in your Settings, it might just not be available in your app version yet. Updating Telegram sometimes helps. ([Telegram][3])

---

If you want, I can help you **check if your Telegram app supports passkeys right now** — just tell me whether you’re on Android, iPhone, or desktop. 🌙✨
