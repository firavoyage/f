Here’s a detailed comparison, broken down by concept and context.

### At a Glance: The Core Difference

### Key Differences Explained with Examples

The best way to understand the difference is to see them in similar contexts.

#### 1. Physical Objects

- **A Clean Window:** The window has been washed. There is no dirt, dust, or grime on its surface.
- **A Clear Window:** The glass itself is transparent, allowing you to see through it easily. A window can be _clean_ but not _clear_ if it's made of frosted glass.

- **Clean Water:** The water is free from germs, bacteria, or pollutants. It is safe to drink.
- **Clear Water:** The water is transparent, not muddy or cloudy. You can see to the bottom. **Water can be clear but not clean** (e.g., clear water from a stream may still contain harmful bacteria).

#### 2. Communication and Understanding

- **Clean Speech:** Speech that is free from profanity or offensive language.
- **Clear Speech:** Speech that is easy to understand and not mumbled or confusing. The instructions are perfectly understandable.

- **A Clean Copy:** A document with no errors or marks.
- **A Clear Copy:** A document that is easy to read, either because of good handwriting, font, or a high-quality photocopy.

#### 3. Situations and States

- **A Clean Room:** A room that is tidy, dusted, and vacuumed.
- **A Clear Room:** A room that is empty of furniture or people. (e.g., "We need to clear the room for the meeting.")

- **A Clean Conscience:** A conscience free from guilt or regret.
- **A Clear Conscience:** This is also used, but it emphasizes the _transparency_ and lack of confusion in your moral state. You know you have done nothing wrong.

### When They Overlap

There are situations where the words can seem interchangeable because achieving one often leads to the other.

- **"I need to clean my glasses."** (Remove smudges and dirt)
- **"I need to clear my glasses."** (Remove an obstruction, like fog)

  - In both cases, the goal is to see better, but the action is slightly different.

- **"The data is clean."** (Free from errors or duplicates)
- **"The data is clear."** (Easy to interpret and understand)
  - Clean data often leads to clear conclusions, but they are not the same thing.

### Summary

Think of it this way:

- You **clean** something by **washing, wiping, or purifying** it.
- You **clear** something by **removing obstacles, explaining it, or making it transparent.**

You **clean** a messy desk, but you **clear** a crowded desk.
You **clean** the air of pollutants, but you **clear** the air of misunderstandings.

which would you think is more likely to be for organizing things

---

Excellent question. Based on the core meanings, **"clear" is significantly more likely to be used for organizing things.**

Here's why:

### "Clear" is about creating order and space.

The action of organizing almost always involves removing obstacles, decluttering, and creating a structured, usable space. This is the essence of "clear."

- **"Clear your desk"** means to remove the clutter, files, and coffee cups so you have space to work and can find what you need.
- **"Clear out the closet"** means to sort through the contents, remove what you don't need, and organize what's left.
- **"Clear your inbox"** means to process emails, file them, delete them, and achieve "inbox zero"—a state of organization.

In all these cases, "clear" implies a process of **sorting, removing, and creating order.**

---

### "Clean" is about removing dirt and grime.

While you often clean _while_ you organize, the word "clean" itself focuses on hygiene, not order.

- **"Clean your desk"** means to wipe it down with a cloth and cleaner to remove dust and stains.
- **"Clean the closet"** means to vacuum the floor and wipe down the shelves.
- You wouldn't say "clean your inbox" to mean organizing emails; you would say it if you were, for some reason, removing viruses or digital "grime."

A space can be perfectly **clean** (spotless) but still be completely **disorganized**. Conversely, a space can be **organized** but **dirty**.

### The Best Way to Remember It

Think of the process:

- First, you **CLEAR** the clutter. (This is the organizing step).
- Then, you **CLEAN** the surfaces. (This is the hygiene step).

**Conclusion:** For the specific task of **organizing things—creating order, structure, and accessibility—"clear" is the much more accurate and likely word.**
