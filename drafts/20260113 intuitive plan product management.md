How is a Product Management in big software companies. Show me a mindmap about deciding the order of things as a nested list.

---

Alright, Fira. Let’s look at this gently and clearly.

In big software companies, **Product Management** is less about having ideas and more about **deciding what comes first** when everything feels important.
The work is calm on the surface, but underneath, it’s a constant practice of balance.

Here is a **mindmap as a nested list** for how Product Managers usually decide the order of things (prioritization).

---

### Product Management: Deciding the Order of Things

- **Company Direction**

  - Vision and long-term strategy
  - Business goals (growth, revenue, retention)
  - Leadership priorities
  - Market positioning

- **User Value**

  - Core user problems
  - Frequency of the problem
  - Severity of the pain
  - Impact on user trust or satisfaction
  - Feedback and real usage data

- **Business Impact**

  - Revenue potential
  - Cost reduction
  - Risk mitigation
  - Competitive advantage
  - Contractual or legal commitments

- **Evidence & Data**

  - Usage metrics
  - Funnel drop-offs
  - A/B test results
  - Customer support trends
  - Research insights

- **Effort & Feasibility**

  - Engineering complexity
  - Time to build
  - Technical debt
  - Dependencies between teams
  - Available skills and capacity

- **Risk & Urgency**

  - Security or stability issues
  - Regulatory deadlines
  - Bugs affecting core flows
  - Reputation or brand risk

- **Sequencing Logic**

  - Foundational work first
  - Unlocking future features
  - Reducing unknowns early
  - Learning before scaling

- **Stakeholder Balance**

  - Engineering constraints
  - Design quality
  - Sales and customer promises
  - Support team pain points
  - Leadership expectations

- **Prioritization Frameworks (Tools, not rules)**

  - Impact vs Effort
  - RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)
  - MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won’t)
  - Opportunity scoring

- **Final Judgment (The Quiet Part)**

  - What will matter in 6–12 months?
  - What regret can we live with?
  - What creates momentum?
  - What aligns best _right now_?

---

If I were sitting next to you, I’d say this softly:

> In big companies, Product Management is not about finding the _perfect_ order.
> It’s about choosing an order that makes sense **with the information you have today**,
> and being calm enough to change it tomorrow.

If you want, Fira, we can:

- walk through a **real example**, or
- compare **big company PM vs startup PM**, or
- zoom into **how PMs say “not now” without burning trust**

Just tell me where you’d like clarity next.

How to decide what to do first

---

Alright, Fira.
Let’s slow this down and make it simple.

When everything feels important, the question is not _“What is best?”_
The real question is _“What must come first?”_

Here is a calm way Product Managers decide.

---

### A Simple Way to Decide What to Do First

**1. Start with the constraint**

- What will break if we don’t act?
- What blocks everything else?
- What has a deadline we can’t move?

> Fix the floor before painting the walls.

---

**2. Ask: who is hurting the most?**

- Is this pain frequent?
- Is it stopping users from succeeding?
- Is it hurting trust or credibility?

> Loud pain beats clever ideas.

---

**3. Look for leverage**

- What unlocks many things later?
- What reduces future effort?
- What gives us learning quickly?

> Do the thing that makes the next ten things easier.

---

**4. Balance impact with effort**

- High impact, low effort → do first
- High impact, high effort → plan carefully
- Low impact, high effort → usually no

> Energy is limited. Spend it where it moves the needle.

---

**5. Respect reality**

- What can the team actually do now?
- What skills are available?
- What dependencies exist?

> A small thing done is better than a big thing imagined.

---

**6. Make a decision, not a promise**

- Decide for _now_, not forever
- Be clear that priorities can change
- Write down _why_ you chose this

> Confidence comes from clarity, not certainty.

---

### A Quiet Rule Many PMs Use (but rarely say)

If we do nothing else this quarter,
**what one thing would we regret not doing?**

That’s usually your first item.

---

If you want, Fira, we can:

- practice this with **your real work**
- turn this into a **1-page decision checklist**
- or talk about **how to explain your choice to others calmly**

Take your time. I’m here.
