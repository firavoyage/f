what have you seen

This is the main menu/home screen of **Shadowverse**, a digital collectible card game by Cygames.

From the screenshot, here’s what I can see:

- The player’s name is “PROAPK” with Collection Level 2.
- They’re still very new: Ranked placement shows “Beginner 0” with 0/10 wins in each of the three placement tiers.
- They haven’t completed the “First Farer Missions” yet (0/9 progress, which normally rewards a free deck and some packs).
- Battle Pass Season 1 is active but barely started.
- The featured leader skin/art is the limited “Ragna Blade Israfil” (a very premium/cosmetic leader from a past collaboration or special pack).
- There’s an active banner for “Special Deals on Crystals” (the premium currency) and “Ongoing Events.”
- The player has 0 gold and 0 crystals/vials visible in the top-right corner.
- Bottom navigation shows the standard tabs: Solo, Multi, Arena, Home (current), Cards, Shop, Park (the social/guild area).

So basically, this is someone who just started a fresh account (or reset one) and is looking at the shop deals to buy crystals, probably to get some packs or the Israfil leader skin.
