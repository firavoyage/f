write a css theme for my presentation web app.

- the browser's default stylesheet has already been reset before your css. you should set them again if needed, for example, strong element to be bold.
- the presentation is shown on laptop.
- the page can be selected by .pre
- the page may contain any html element from markdown
- the page can be vertically scrolled if the content gets too long. but if there is need of a horizontal scrollbar, start a new line instead. the scrollbar should be soft without small triangles on the both ends.
- the page should cover the full screen. the content should be horizontally centered. since the screen is wide, the page should have more padding on the left and the right.
- the theme
  - light, but not #fff background
  - code is already styled by prism
