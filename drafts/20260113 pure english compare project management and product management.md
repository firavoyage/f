compare project management and product management

---

Here’s a clear, side-by-side comparison of **Project Management** and **Product Management**, followed by a simple summary to help you decide which fits a given situation better.

---

## High-level difference

- **Project Management** focuses on **delivering a specific output** on time, within scope, and on budget.
- **Product Management** focuses on **creating long-term value** by building and evolving a product that meets user and business needs.

| **Core question**        | _How do we deliver this project successfully?_ | _What should we build and why?_           |
| **Time horizon**         | Finite (has a clear start and end)             | Ongoing (product lifecycle)               |
| **Success metrics**      | On time, on budget, in scope                   | User adoption, revenue, retention, impact |

| **Customer involvement** | Limited or indirect                            | Continuous and central                    |
| **Decision authority**   | Tactical decisions                             | Strategic decisions                       |

## When each is needed

- Use **Project Management** when:

  - The goal is well-defined
  - Requirements are largely known
  - Delivery date and budget are fixed
  - Example: office relocation, system migration

- Use **Product Management** when:

  - The problem is uncertain
  - Customer needs may evolve
  - Long-term value matters more than delivery date
  - Example: building a SaaS product, mobile app

---

## How they work together

In modern organizations, **product managers decide _what_ and _why_**, while **project managers help with _how_ and _when_**. In Agile teams, some project management responsibilities are absorbed by Scrum Masters or delivery leads.
