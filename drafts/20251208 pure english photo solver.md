how would i call apps like zuoyebang, xiaoyuansouti, socratic

---

If by **“call apps”** you mean _how to use or activate them to solve questions_, here’s a simple guide for each one:

---

## ✅ **1. Zuoyebang (作业帮)**

Zuoyebang is a Chinese homework-helper app.

### **How to use / “call” it**

1. **Download** it from the App Store / Google Play / Chinese app stores.
2. Open the app and:

   - Tap **拍照搜题** (take a photo to search).
   - Take a clear picture of the question.
   - Zuoyebang will recognize the text and give solutions or explanations.

### **Common features**

- Photo search
- Live tutoring
- Practice sets
- Textbook solutions

---

## ✅ **2. Xiaoyuansouti (小猿搜题)**

Another popular Chinese photo-search study app.

### **How to use / “call” it**

1. Install the app.
2. Open it and tap the **camera button**.
3. Take a photo of your question.
4. The app will identify the question and show worked solutions.

### **Also offers**

- Step-by-step math explanations
- English reading solutions
- AI analysis of weak areas

---

## ✅ **3. Socratic (by Google)**

An English-language homework helper.

### **How to use / “call” it**

1. Install Socratic from the App Store / Play Store.
2. Open it and:

   - Tap the **camera icon**.
   - Take a picture of the problem, or type it.

3. Socratic will:

   - Explain steps
   - Link to relevant concepts
   - Provide videos and resources

---

## **If you meant “call” them programmatically (API)**

None of these apps officially provide public APIs, so you _cannot_ reliably call them directly from code. People typically:

- Use the mobile app
- Or use OCR + search engines to do something similar

---

## If you tell me **your use case**, I can give more specific instructions:

For example:

- “I want to integrate something like Socratic into my own app.”
- “I want the shortcuts/voice command that opens those apps.”
- “I want to use them to solve math homework fast.”

Just tell me what you want to achieve!

i mean how to say im using one of these apps, without mentioning the name of each.

---

Here are some natural ways to say **you’re using an app like Zuoyebang / Xiaoyuansouti / Socratic without naming it**:

---

## ✅ **1. General phrases**

- “I’m using a homework-help app.”
- “I’m using a study-assistant app.”
- “I used an app that solves questions for you.”
- “I looked it up on a learning app.”
- “I used a photo-search homework app.”

---

## ✅ **2. If you want to imply _photo-based_ question solving**

- “I used a photo-search study tool.”
- “I took a picture of the problem using a homework scanner app.”
- “I used an app that lets you scan problems to get solutions.”

---

## ✅ **3. If you want to sound casual**

- “I used one of those homework apps.”
- “I checked it with a study app.”
- “I used one of those apps that solves questions when you scan them.”

---

## ✅ **4. If you want to be vague**

- “I used an app to help with this.”
- “I checked it with an online tool.”
- “I used a learning app for the answer.”

---

If you want, I can tailor a sentence for:

- texting friends
- talking to teachers
- academic writing
- casual chat

Just tell me the tone you want!

<!--

Too technical and unclear

English speakers **never** refer to these apps this way.

ive used "problem solution index", but i found that it's not precise, at least in google search.

---

If you want a **precise, natural phrase** that means “an app that solves homework problems” but **is not a specific brand name**, here are _much better options_ than **“problem solution index”** (which does sound unnatural in English).

---

## ✅ **Best natural alternatives**

#### **1. Homework-solver app**

> “I used a homework-solver app.”

Most native-sounding and instantly clear.

#### **2. Study-helper app**

> “I used a study-helper app.”

Neutral and fits Zuoyebang / Xiaoyuansouti / Socratic.

#### **3. Photo-solver app**

> “I used a photo-solver app.”

Perfect if the app uses camera-based question solving.

#### **4. Learning-assistant app**

> “I used a learning-assistant app.”

Soft, vague, teacher-safe.

#### **5. Homework-scanning app**

> “I used a homework-scanning app.”

Specifies the scanning feature clearly.

---

## ✅ **More professional or academic**

- “I used an educational problem-solving tool.”
- “I used an AI-based study tool.”
- “I consulted an online problem-solving service.”
- “I used an academic assistance app.”

---

## ❌ Why “problem solution index” doesn’t work

- Not idiomatic in English
- Sounds like a database or catalog, not an app
- Too technical and unclear

English speakers **never** refer to these apps this way.

---

## 👍 If you tell me your intended tone (casual, formal, hiding it from a teacher, describing it in an essay, etc.), I can pick the _exactly best_ phrasing for your situation.

how to say ive done all the problems from page 1 to page x

---

Here are natural, correct ways to say it in English:

---

## ✅ **Most common**

- **“I’ve done all the problems from page 1 to page X.”**

---

## ✅ **More polished / natural variations**

- **“I’ve completed all the problems from page 1 through page X.”**
- **“I’ve finished all the exercises from page 1 to page X.”**
- **“I’ve worked through all the problems from page 1 to page X.”**

---

## ✅ **More formal**

- **“I have completed every problem from page 1 through page X.”**
- **“I have finished the full set of exercises from page 1 to page X.”**

---

## Notes

- **“through”** often sounds a bit more polished than **“to.”**
- **“problems”** vs **“exercises”** depends on subject—either is fine.

If you want, tell me the exact page numbers and the context (school, homework message, email, etc.), and I can tailor the sentence perfectly.

# 5

i dont want to mention page 1. only say page x. be concise.

---

Here are concise options without mentioning page 1:

- **“I’ve done all the problems up to page X.”**
- **“I’ve completed everything up to page X.”**
- **“I’ve finished all the exercises up to page X.”**

If you want it even shorter, the first one is best.
