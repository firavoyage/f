can a post on zenodo be taken down

---

Yes, Fira… but not in the simple way people imagine.

Zenodo is built around permanence. When you publish something there, especially once it has a DOI, it’s meant to stay part of the scholarly record. That’s the whole spirit of it — preservation, not convenience.

So you can’t just casually delete a post because you changed your mind.

But removal can happen in certain situations — like copyright violations, legal issues, privacy concerns, or serious policy breaches. In those cases, Zenodo may restrict access or remove the file. Often, though, the record itself remains visible, with a note explaining why the content was removed. The idea is transparency.

There’s also a softer path: if it’s your own upload and you catch a mistake, you can usually upload a new version. Zenodo keeps version history. The old version doesn’t vanish, but the new one becomes the current reference.

It’s less like editing a social media post… and more like adding a new page to a library archive.

Why are you asking?


# 2

yeah like copyright

---

Yes, Fira.

If there’s a real copyright problem, a post on Zenodo can be taken down.

Zenodo follows copyright law. If someone reports that a file violates their rights — for example, you uploaded a published paper owned by a journal, or used images/data you don’t have permission for — they can file a formal complaint. Zenodo will review it. If the claim is valid, they usually remove or restrict access to the file.

Often, the record itself stays visible. It may say something like “removed due to copyright claim.” The idea is to keep the scholarly trail intact, even if the content itself isn’t accessible anymore.

It’s not automatic, and it’s not casual. There has to be a proper request.

Are you worried about something you uploaded… or something someone else did?


# 3

is there some techinical limit, like what if someone reg a lot of accounts and publish a lot of films

---

That’s an interesting edge case, Fira.

Technically, yes — there are limits.

Zenodo isn’t an open dump where you can endlessly upload anything. They have storage limits per dataset and general fair-use expectations. Large files — like full films — are allowed in principle, but there are size caps per upload, and accounts can’t just expand infinitely without review.

More importantly, they monitor for abuse.

If someone created many accounts just to mass-upload copyrighted movies, that would trigger attention very quickly. Platforms like Zenodo have automated systems and human moderation. Unusual activity patterns — dozens of accounts, repeated large uploads, copyrighted commercial films — those are red flags.

And even beyond technical limits, there’s legal pressure. If studios or rights holders notice, they file complaints. Then content gets restricted, accounts can be suspended, IPs blocked.

Zenodo is designed for research preservation, not for piracy. If someone tried to treat it like a file-sharing site, it wouldn’t last long.

You’re thinking about system boundaries — where openness meets misuse. That’s always a delicate line.

what size cap, what limit, exactly

---

There *are* clear technical limits on file sizes and upload volumes on Zenodo — and they’re not infinite, Fira. ([Zenodo][1])

**Here’s what the official limits look like:**

* **Per record (dataset) total size:** up to about **50 GB** in total for all files combined. ([Zenodo][1])
* **Number of files per record:** up to **100 files**. ([Zenodo][1])
* **Higher quota possible:** you can request a one-time increase up to **200 GB**, but it isn’t automatic — you have to explain your research use case. ([Zenodo][2])
* **No built-in per-file cap beyond that total** — the main constraint is the overall dataset size and file count. ([Zenodo][3])

These numbers are practical technical constraints that help keep the service manageable and aligned with research sharing, rather than acting as a free, limitless file-dump service. ([Zenodo][1])

So you *couldn’t* just upload lots of full-length films (which are often tens of gigabytes each) in one record; you’d hit that ~50 GB + 100-file boundary pretty fast without special approval. The limits are there to keep the repository sustainable and focused on research outputs. ([Zenodo][1])

seems pretty large. and the account reg is quite easy. just like github is a place where pdfs are shared on the open internet, while z library is a bit restricted. 

---

It does seem large, Fira. Fifty gigabytes is not small. It feels generous.

But there’s something subtle here.

Zenodo is built for research archiving. Large datasets in science — genomic data, climate simulations, particle physics outputs — can easily reach tens of gigabytes. So that size isn’t meant as generosity toward casual sharing. It’s meant to support legitimate academic work.

Account registration being easy doesn’t mean the system is loose. Many research platforms keep signup friction low but rely on monitoring, reporting systems, DOI traceability, and institutional norms to prevent abuse. Once you attach a DOI and metadata, there’s a visible trail. It’s not anonymous in the way some file-sharing sites are.

You mentioned the difference between something like GitHub and Z-Library. That’s an important distinction.

GitHub is open infrastructure — people can upload almost anything, including PDFs. But it responds quickly to copyright complaints, and repositories get taken down all the time. It’s built for code, not piracy.

Z-Library, on the other hand, was structured specifically around distributing copyrighted books outside legal channels. That’s why it operates under constant legal pressure and domain seizures.

The key difference isn’t just openness. It’s intention, governance, and how quickly a platform reacts when misuse appears.

An open system always carries risk. But openness doesn’t mean absence of oversight.

You’re noticing how thin that line can feel.

what if i publish some example blender opensource films

---

If you publish example Blender open-source films, that’s a completely different situation, Fira.

If the films are truly open source — meaning they’re released under a Creative Commons license or another open license — then uploading them to Zenodo is not automatically a problem.

For example, the Blender Foundation has released several open movies like

* Big Buck Bunny
* Sintel
* Tears of Steel

These were published under Creative Commons licenses that allow redistribution.

But here’s the quiet part that matters:
Even when something is open source, you still have to respect the license terms. Some licenses require attribution. Some restrict commercial use. Some require that derivatives be shared under the same license.

And beyond legality, there’s intention.

Zenodo is meant for research outputs. Uploading Blender films *as research material* — for example, if you’re citing them in a paper about rendering pipelines — makes sense. Uploading them just to mirror publicly available films might not violate copyright, but it may be considered misuse of repository purpose.

Open license doesn’t always mean “upload anywhere for any reason.”
It means “you can reuse this — within the license terms.”

It’s less about “can I?” and more about “is this aligned with why the platform exists?”

There’s a difference between legal permission and contextual fit.

no. github is built for code, but it's indeed for piracy. takedown happens, but it doesnt matter in the practical sense.

---

I hear what you’re pointing at, Fira.

You’re saying: in practice, even if something is “not meant” for piracy, people still use it that way — and takedowns don’t really stop the flow.

There’s some truth in that.

GitHub is built for code collaboration. But because it allows public repositories, people sometimes upload copyrighted books, movies, course materials, datasets — things that aren’t supposed to be there. When rights holders notice, they file DMCA notices, and repositories get removed.

But the practical reality of the internet is this:
removal doesn’t erase distribution. Once something is copied, forked, mirrored, downloaded — it spreads. Takedown becomes reactive, not preventive.

That doesn’t mean the platform is “for piracy.” It means open infrastructure can be misused.

The same would apply to Zenodo. If someone tried to use it as a shadow film archive, it might work briefly. But sustained abuse attracts moderation, account bans, IP blocking, institutional pressure.

The deeper thing here isn’t about file size limits.

It’s about how openness and enforcement coexist.
Open systems accept a degree of leakage. They rely on norms, reporting, and traceability rather than heavy upfront restriction.

You’re noticing that in practice, enforcement always lags behind behavior.

And that’s not wrong.

like if i just upload the example film on zenodo, as file sharing instead of research, and i report it myself, what would happen.

---

If you uploaded, say, **Big Buck Bunny** to **Zenodo**, not as part of research but simply as file sharing… and then you reported it yourself…

Very likely, nothing dramatic would happen.

Why?

Because *Big Buck Bunny* is released under a Creative Commons license by the Blender Foundation. Redistribution is allowed under that license, as long as you follow the terms (like attribution).

So if you reported it claiming “copyright violation,” Zenodo would look at the claim and check the license. If the upload respects the license, there’s no infringement. They wouldn’t remove it just because it isn’t “research enough.”

Now — if the upload clearly violates repository purpose (for example, someone using Zenodo as a random movie mirror), they *could* decide it’s misuse of the service. In that case, they might restrict or remove it under platform policy, not copyright law.

If you reported your own upload falsely — meaning you don’t actually hold the rights and you’re just testing the system — they might simply dismiss the report. Repeated bad-faith reports could get attention.

But one small open-licensed short film? It probably wouldn’t cause much.

The real question under your question feels different.

You’re exploring how systems respond when someone intentionally pokes them.

Sometimes the system reacts.
Sometimes it doesn’t.
And that gap is what you’re curious about.
