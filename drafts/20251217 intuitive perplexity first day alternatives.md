i found perplexity. it's great. what are other things i may like.

---

You’re in a great spot already—Perplexity overlaps with a bunch of tools you’ll probably enjoy too. Here are some categories and specific things to explore.

## Other AI answer engines

If you like Perplexity’s “ask anything, get cited answers” style, these are close cousins:

- ChatGPT – Strong for writing help, coding, and creative brainstorming, with options to browse the web and build custom assistants for specific workflows.
- Claude – Great at long-form reasoning and document-heavy tasks like contracts, research papers, and reports.
- Google Gemini – Tightly integrated with Google services, good for mixing web information with docs, sheets, and Gmail.
- Microsoft Copilot – Embedded in Windows, Office, and Edge, useful if you’re deep in the Microsoft ecosystem for work or school.

## More AI search-style tools

These lean into “search + chat” the way Perplexity does:

- You.com – A conversational search engine with different modes (like “Smart” or “Research”) and customizable assistants.[3][9]
- Komo AI – Focuses on smart search, real-time updates, and idea generation, with a simple interface.[9]
- Brave Leo AI – Built into the Brave browser, combines privacy-focused browsing with AI answers.[9]

## Research and knowledge tools

If you use Perplexity mainly to learn or research, these are worth a look:

- Consensus – Answers questions by pulling from scientific papers, useful for evidence-based or academic queries.[4]
- Phind – Geared toward developers, combining web search with coding help and technical documentation.[6]
- Hudson Labs – Finance-focused AI research platform for quickly searching filings, earnings, and market data.[7]

## Personal productivity and “AI sidekick” apps

These feel like having an assistant across your devices:

- Pi – A conversational, empathetic AI focused on chatting, planning, and light brainstorming in a more personal tone.[9]
- Poe – A hub app that lets you chat with multiple AI models (Claude, GPT, etc.) in one place.[9]
- Comet – A browser that uses Perplexity as its engine and can search your browsing history, handle emails, manage tabs, and act on pages for you.

If you share how you mainly use Perplexity (learning, coding, work, personal life, etc.), a more tailored short list can be suggested.

compare perplexity, komo, pi, poe in a table. use some decent metrics.

---

Here’s a concise comparison of Perplexity, Komo, Pi, and Poe on practical metrics like focus, models, pricing, and best use cases.[1][9]

## Overview

| Metric / Tool            | Perplexity                                                                                                            | Komo                                                                                                | Pi                                                                                                   | Poe                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary focus            | AI answer engine + web search with strong citations and research features. [1][10]                                    | AI search engine with emphasis on privacy, modes (Ask/Research/Explore/Search), and ad‑free UI. [9] | Always-on “companion” chat focused on personal, empathetic conversations and light assistance. [9]   | Front-end hub for many models, focused on fast, conversational chat and experimentation. [1][9]              |
| Best for                 | Research, fact-checking, learning, and complex queries where source quality matters. [1][10]                          | Quick web answers and exploration if you care about privacy and a search-like feel. [9]             | Daily check-ins, planning, brainstorming, and casual help with a more emotional tone. [9]            | Trying multiple models, casual Q&A, and conversational use across devices. [1][9]                            |
| Search / web integration | Deep integration: live web search, citations, “Pro/Deep” research modes. [1][10]                                      | Strong: built as an AI search engine with multiple modes and cited results. [9]                     | Limited: more chat‑first, not designed as a web search engine. [9]                                   | Varies by bot; some bots browse, but Poe itself is more chat/platform than search-first. [1][7]              |
| Model variety            | Uses high-end models under the hood; choice mainly via modes (Quick/Pro/Deep/etc.), not manual model picking. [4][10] | Supports several frontier models behind the scenes, typically abstracted away from user. [9]        | Runs on strong LLMs but user doesn’t usually choose models; optimized for consistent Pi persona. [9] | Big variety (Claude, GPT-family, others), plus user-made bots; you can pick which to use per chat. [1][5][7] |
| Conversation style       | Concise, source-backed, task-oriented; less “chatty” than companion AIs. [1][10]                                      | Direct and utilitarian, tuned for search-style Q&A more than long chats. [9]                        | Very warm, empathetic, reflective; often asks about feelings and context. [9]                        | Chatty, fast, often more “fun”; tone varies a lot by which bot/model is chosen. [1][5]                       |
| Pricing basics           | Free tier plus paid Pro with more searches, better modes, and higher limits. [10]                                     | Free tier plus paid options; limits and advanced features expand with paid plans. [9]               | Free with optional subscription for higher limits and advanced capabilities. [9]                     | Free tier with daily limits; subscription unlocks higher usage and more powerful models. [5][7]              |
| Strengths                | High accuracy, strong citations, very good for serious research and learning. [1][10]                                 | Privacy focus, multiple search modes, clean and ad‑free experience. [9]                             | Emotional intelligence, planning and reflection, “talking to a person” feel. [9]                     | Model hub flexibility, speed, good UX for exploring different AIs in one place. [1][5]                       |
| Weak points              | Less personality than companion apps; heavy research modes can be overkill for casual chat. [1][10]                   | Smaller ecosystem and less personality than Pi/Poe; some features behind paywall. [9]               | Not optimized for cited research or heavy technical tasks. [9]                                       | Quality varies by bot; not as focused on rigorous, citation-heavy search as Perplexity. [1][7]               |

## How to choose

- Prefer Perplexity if you care most about accuracy, sources, and doing “real” research.[10][1]
- Prefer Komo if you want a privacy-first, ad-free AI search engine with clear modes.[9]
- Prefer Pi if you mainly want a thoughtful conversational companion that helps you think and plan.[9]
- Prefer Poe if you enjoy trying many models/bots in one place and value speed and conversational feel.[5][1]

If you describe how you’re mostly using Perplexity (study, coding, life planning, etc.), a more opinionated recommendation can be given.

# 4

i want to create a game for free. i need to brainstorm, plan, design, and implement. what's your recommedation. take all resources on the free internet into consideration. compare and recommend popular llms.

---

Godot stands out as the top free recommendation for creating a game from brainstorm to implementation, thanks to its fully open-source nature, no revenue limits, and strong community support for beginners. It handles 2D/3D design, scripting (visual or GDScript), and export to all platforms without hidden costs. Pair it with free assets from OpenGameArt and tutorials on YouTube for a complete zero-cost pipeline.[1][6]

## Free Workflow Steps

- **Brainstorm & Plan**: Use Notion or Obsidian (free note-taking apps) for game design docs, mind maps, and task lists; leverage LLMs below for idea generation.
- **Design Assets**: Blender for 3D models/animations, Krita or Aseprite (free compile from GitHub) for 2D art, Bfxr for sound effects, and Bosca Ceoil for music.[5][1]
- **Implement & Test**: Build in Godot (or GDevelop for no-code 2D), version control with GitHub, and publish to itch.io.[2][1]

## LLM Comparison for Game Dev Assistance

These popular free-tier LLMs excel at brainstorming mechanics, generating code snippets, debugging, and design feedback—use them iteratively in your workflow.

| LLM / Metric | Strengths for Game Dev                                                              | Free Limits                                        | Best Use Cases                                                  | Weaknesses                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Perplexity   | Cited research on tutorials/tools, accurate asset suggestions, planning breakdowns. | Unlimited basic searches; Pro for deeper analysis. | Finding free resources, GDD outlines, engine comparisons. [11]  | Less creative for wild ideas; research-focused. |
| Poe          | Access to multiple models (Claude/GPT) for code gen, bot creation for game sims.    | Daily messages; sub for unlimited.                 | Generating GDScript/C# snippets, playtesting via chat. [11][12] | Quality varies by bot; not search-first.        |
| Komo         | Privacy-focused search for dev docs/modes (Research for deep dives).                | Free tier with limits.                             | Quick engine queries, trend exploration for mechanics. [13]     | Less versatile for pure code/brainstorm.        |
| Pi           | Empathetic planning chats, motivational breakdowns of complex projects.             | Unlimited basic use.                               | Daily motivation, simplifying scopes for solo devs. [13]        | Not technical/coded; chatty over precise.       |

## Final Pick

Start with Godot + Perplexity/Poe combo: Perplexity for researched planning/resources, Poe for code and iteration. This keeps everything free, scalable, and leverages your familiarity. Prototype a simple 2D game (like a platformer) in a weekend using their official docs.[6][1]
