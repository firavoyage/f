### TL;DR
* **80.9% SWE-bench Verified**— First model to cross the 80% threshold. GPT-5.1-Codex-Max sits at 77.9%.
* **Beat all human candidates**— In Anthropic's internal engineering test, Opus 4.5 surpassed every human applicant's score.
* **66% cheaper**— Now $5/$25 per million tokens (was $15/$75).
* **Hybrid reasoning**— Extended thinking + "effort" parameter lets you control compute vs. speed.
#### Transparency Note
This article uses AI assistance for research and drafting. The claims about Claude Opus 4.5's performance come from Anthropic's official announcements and third-party benchmark verifications. We cover Anthropic as we would any AI company —with the same scrutiny we'd apply to OpenAI, Google, or others.
Here's a sentence that would have seemed absurd two years ago: An AI model just outscored every human candidate who applied for an engineering job at one of the world's top AI companies.
That's what Anthropic claims happened with Claude Opus 4.5. Released November 24, 2025, it's the first model to exceed 80% on SWE-bench Verified —the benchmark that measures whether AI can actually fix real bugs in real codebases.
Let's break down what this means, what it doesn't mean, and why the "beat human engineers" claim needs more context than the headlines give it.

![Refact.ai AI Agent for programming became the best AI tool on SWE-bench lite]
[Refact.ai Agent has achieved the**#1 score on SWE-bench Lite**] **— solving 179 out of 300 tasks**, for a 59,7% success rate. This result puts Refact.ai at the top of the leaderboard and makes it the**best-performing**[**open-source AI agent for programming**] **on SWE-bench Lite**to date.
*SWE-bench Lite is a benchmark that evaluates LLM-based systems on real GitHub issues from popular open-source Python projects. Each task requires applying a bug fix or feature implementation, then validating the result through test execution. This makes the benchmark particularly valuable for understanding how AI tools will perform in actual production environments.*
## Agent setup
Refact.ai Agent takes a fully autonomous, iterative approach. It plans, executes, tests, and self-corrects —repeating steps as needed to**reach a single correct solution with no user input.**So, the benchmark setup was designed to reflect our autonomy-first philosophy:
* **Prompt strategy**: Defines the Agent’s behavior and high-level task-solving logic. Open-source and available[on GitHub].
* **Model**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet —responsible for orchestration and decision-making.
* **Execution layer**:`refact-lsp`, a backend that connects the model to tools and the enviro

We're thrilled to announce that OpenHands has reached a new milestone, achieving state-of-the-art results on SWE-Bench Verified!
![OpenHands Performance on Leaderboard]
## SWE-Bench and OpenHands
[SWE-bench] is the most popular benchmark for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) capabilities in addressing real-world software engineering challenges. It consists of issues and corresponding pull requests from 12 popular Python repositories on GitHub, tasking systems with generating code patches to resolve specified issues. The*verified*subset we evaluated on consists of 500 carefully selected test cases that have been manually reviewed by[human software developers] to verify they have appropriately scoped unit tests and well-specified issue descriptions.

⚠️ HIGH

**Engineering Rigor**

Claude Code CLI, OpenCode, Aider

> "The era of 'magic' AI coding is over. The era of managed, verified, and economically rational AI engineering has begun."

### The "AI Slop" Crisis

[](#the-ai-slop-crisis)

> "A junior engineer merged 1,000 lines of AI-generated code that broke a test environment; the code was so convoluted that rewriting it from scratch was faster than debugging." — HN

## 🚨 Security Alert: The "Zeta-Decoder" Attack Vector

[](#-security-alert-the-zeta-decoder-attack-vector)

**Critical finding from security researchers:**

> In 80 rounds of prompting, GPT-4o hallucinated **112 unique, non-existent packages** (e.g., `zeta-decoder`, `rtlog`).

**Attack mechanism:**

1.  Attacker identifies hallucinated package names
2.  Registers them on PyPI/npm with malicious payloads
3.  Developer's AI suggests `pip install zeta-decoder`
4.  Malware installed into secure environment

**⚠️ Mandatory Protocol:** Never blindly install AI-suggested libraries. Verify EVERY dependency manually.

## 🔀 The BYOK Migration

[](#-the-byok-migration)

**Power users are leaving opaque SaaS for BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) architectures:**

From

To

Reason

Cursor

OpenCode

Cost transparency, model swapping

Cursor

Claude Code CLI

Terminal power, explicit context control

Windsurf

Aider

Token efficiency, git integration

> "This allows users to granularly control costs—using DeepSeek for cheap iterations and swapping to Opus 4.5 for final architectural reviews—without being locked into a SaaS markup."

[](#swiftui-workaround)

> Developers have built **custom MCP servers** (e.g., "SwiftZilla") that feed verified, up-to-date documentation directly into the agent's context window.

---

## 📋 Strategic Recommendations

[](#-strategic-recommendations)

### The "Plan Mode" Protocol

[](#the-plan-mode-protocol)

> Before allowing an agent to write code, explicitly prompt for a **text-based architectural plan**.

```

"Plan this: [describe task]"

```

This forces the model to:

-   Articulate logic
-   Identify dependencies
-   Outline changes BEFORE committing to code
-   Drastically reduces "infinite repair loops"

### The "Two-Tier" Workflow

[](#the-two-tier-workflow)

1.  **Expensive models (Opus 4.5)** → Planning and complex review ONLY
2.  **Cheap models (DeepSeek V3, Minimax)** → Code generation and unit tests

This optimizes "intelligence-per-dollar" ratio.

## Assistant (Build · big-pickle · 6.1s)


I don't have a specific SWE benchmark score because my performance depends on the model you connect me to through OpenCode's BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) architecture.

**Key points:**
- **OpenCode is the interface, not the model** - You can connect any LLM provider
- **SWE scores vary by model**: Claude 3.5 Opus 4.5 (80.9%), Claude 3.7 Sonnet (62.3%), DeepSeek V3, etc.
- **My actual capabilities = your chosen model + my tools**

**Current top performers** (from the benchmark):
- Claude 3.5 Opus 4.5: 80.9% SWE-bench Verified
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet: 62.3% SWE-bench
- Open-source models like Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B

For my specific performance, I'd need you to tell me which model you're using with OpenCode, or we could test on a specific coding task.

## User

# Intro

Get started with OpenCode.

[**OpenCode**](/) is an open source AI coding agent. It’s available as a terminal-based interface, desktop app, or IDE extension.

![OpenCode TUI with the opencode theme](/docs/_astro/screenshot.CQjBbRyJ_1dLadc.webp)

Let’s get started.

---

#### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

To use OpenCode in your terminal, you’ll need:

1.  A modern terminal emulator like:

    -   [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), cross-platform
    -   [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), cross-platform
    -   [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), Linux and macOS
    -   [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), Linux and macOS
2.  API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.


---

## [Install](#install)

The easiest way to install OpenCode is through the install script.

Terminal window

```

curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

````

You can also install it with the following commands:

-   **Using Node.js**

    -   [npm](#tab-panel-0)
    -   [Bun](#tab-panel-1)
    -   [pnpm](#tab-panel-2)
    -   [Yarn](#tab-panel-3)

    Terminal window

    ```
    npm install -g opencode-ai
    ```

    Terminal window

    ```
    bun install -g opencode-ai
    ```

    Terminal window

    ```
    pnpm install -g opencode-ai
    ```

    Terminal window

    ```
    yarn global add opencode-ai
    ```

-   **Using Homebrew on macOS and Linux**

    Terminal window

    ```
    brew install anomalyco/tap/opencode
    ```

    > We recommend using the OpenCode tap for the most up to date releases. The official `brew install opencode` formula is maintained by the Homebrew team and is updated less frequently.

-   **Using Paru on Arch Linux**

    Terminal window

    ```
    paru -S opencode-bin
    ```


#### [Windows](#windows)

-   **Using Chocolatey**

    Terminal window

    ```
    choco install opencode
    ```

-   **Using Scoop**

    Terminal window

    ```
    scoop bucket add extrasscoop install extras/opencode
    ```

-   **Using NPM**

    Terminal window

    ```
    npm install -g opencode-ai
    ```

-   **Using Mise**

    Terminal window

    ```
    mise use -g github:anomalyco/opencode
    ```

-   **Using Docker**

    Terminal window

    ```
    docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/anomalyco/opencode
    ```


Support for installing OpenCode on Windows using Bun is currently in progress.

You can also grab the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/releases).

---

## [Configure](#configure)

With OpenCode you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.

If you are new to using LLM providers, we recommend using [OpenCode Zen](/docs/zen). It’s a curated list of models that have been tested and verified by the OpenCode team.

1.  Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select opencode, and head to [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth).

    ```
    /connect
    ```

2.  Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.

3.  Paste your API key.

    ```
    ┌ API key││└ enter
    ```


Alternatively, you can select one of the other providers. [Learn more](/docs/providers#directory).

---

## [Initialize](#initialize)

Now that you’ve configured a provider, you can navigate to a project that you want to work on.

Terminal window

````

cd /path/to/project

```

And run OpenCode.

Terminal window

```

opencode

```

Next, initialize OpenCode for the project by running the following command.

```

/init

```

This will get OpenCode to analyze your project and create an `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.

Tip

You should commit your project’s `AGENTS.md` file to Git.

This helps OpenCode understand the project structure and the coding patterns used.

---

## [Usage](#usage)

You are now ready to use OpenCode to work on your project. Feel free to ask it anything!

If you are new to using an AI coding agent, here are some examples that might help.

---

### [Ask questions](#ask-questions)

You can ask OpenCode to explain the codebase to you.

Tip

Use the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.

```

How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts

````

This is helpful if there’s a part of the codebase that you didn’t work on.

---

### [Add features](#add-features)

You can ask OpenCode to add new features to your project. Though we first recommend asking it to create a plan.

1.  **Create a plan**

    OpenCode has a *Plan mode* that disables its ability to make changes and instead suggest *how* it’ll implement the feature.

    Switch to it using the **Tab** key. You’ll see an indicator for this in the lower right corner.

    ```
    <TAB>
    ```

    Now let’s describe what we want it to do.

    ```
    When a user deletes a note, we'd like to flag it as deleted in the database.Then create a screen that shows all the recently deleted notes.From this screen, the user can undelete a note or permanently delete it.
    ```

    You want to give OpenCode enough details to understand what you want. It helps to talk to it like you are talking to a junior developer on your team.

    Tip

    Give OpenCode plenty of context and examples to help it understand what you want.

2.  **Iterate on the plan**

    Once it gives you a plan, you can give it feedback or add more details.

    ```
    We'd like to design this new screen using a design I've used before.[Image #1] Take a look at this image and use it as a reference.
    ```

    Tip

    Drag and drop images into the terminal to add them to the prompt.

    OpenCode can scan any images you give it and add them to the prompt. You can do this by dragging and dropping an image into the terminal.

3.  **Build the feature**

    Once you feel comfortable with the plan, switch back to *Build mode* by hitting the **Tab** key again.

    ```
    <TAB>
    ```

    And asking it to make the changes.

    ```
    Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.
    ```


---

### [Make changes](#make-changes)

For more straightforward changes, you can ask OpenCode to directly build it without having to review the plan first.

````

We need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this ishandled in the /notes route in @packages/functions/src/notes.ts and implementthe same logic in @packages/functions/src/settings.ts

```

You want to make sure you provide a good amount of detail so OpenCode makes the right changes.

---

### [Undo changes](#undo-changes)

Let’s say you ask OpenCode to make some changes.

```

Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?

```

But you realize that it is not what you wanted. You **can undo** the changes using the `/undo` command.

```

/undo

```

OpenCode will now revert the changes you made and show your original message again.

```

Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?

```

From here you can tweak the prompt and ask OpenCode to try again.

Tip

You can run `/undo` multiple times to undo multiple changes.

Or you **can redo** the changes using the `/redo` command.

```

/redo

```

---

## [Share](#share)

The conversations that you have with OpenCode can be [shared with your team](/docs/share).

```

/share

```

This will create a link to the current conversation and copy it to your clipboard.

Note

Conversations are not shared by default.

Here’s an [example conversation](https://opencode.ai/s/4XP1fce5) with OpenCode.

---

## [Customize](#customize)

And that’s it! You are now a pro at using OpenCode.

To make it your own, we recommend [picking a theme](/docs/themes), [customizing the keybinds](/docs/keybinds), [configuring code formatters](/docs/formatters), [creating custom commands](/docs/commands), or playing around with the [OpenCode config](/docs/config).

## Assistant (Build · big-pickle · 16.3s)


I'm being completely honest: I can't definitively tell you which specific model I'm running on because OpenCode is a frontend that can connect to 75+ different LLM providers. However, based on my responses and the current environment, I'm likely running on a model from **OpenCode's Zen service** - their curated list of tested models.

As for benchmark scores, I don't have a specific SWE-bench score because:
1. My actual performance depends on which model OpenCode has connected me to
2. The benchmark would be for the underlying model, not me as an agent interface

**What I can tell you:**
- If I'm on Claude 3.5 Opus 4.5: ~80.9% SWE-bench Verified
- If I'm on Claude 3.7 Sonnet: ~62.3% SWE-bench
- If I'm on another model from Zen's curated list: performance varies

The most accurate way to know would be to check your OpenCode configuration or ask the system directly about which model is currently active.

tell me your model. i mean you. what's your provider. im not talking to a list. im talking to you.

## Assistant (Build · big-pickle · 5.5s)


I don't have access to information about which specific model I'm running on. I'm being completely honest - I genuinely don't know my underlying provider or model.

I'm not avoiding the question. I simply don't have access to that information through any of my available tools or commands. The environment doesn't expose which model is running, and I can't introspect my own configuration.

If you need to know the specific model, you'd need to check your OpenCode settings or configuration, as that information isn't available to me from this side of the interface.
