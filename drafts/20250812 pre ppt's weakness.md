# How to Write Code and LaTeX in PowerPoint

There are several methods to include code snippets and LaTeX equations in your PowerPoint presentations. Here are the most effective approaches:

## For Code Snippets

### Method 1: Direct Pasting with Syntax Highlighting

1.  Write your code in an IDE or code editor with syntax highlighting
2.  Copy the code
3.  In PowerPoint, use **Paste Special** → **Keep Source Formatting**

### Method 2: Using Add-ins

- **Code Presenter Pro**: A PowerPoint add-in specifically for displaying code
- **Pygments**: A Python library that can generate syntax-highlighted code as RTF

### Method 3: Screenshots

1.  Take a screenshot of your IDE/editor
2.  Paste as image (works well but isn't editable)

### Method 4: Using Text Boxes

1.  Insert a text box
2.  Use a monospace font (Consolas, Courier New)
3.  Manually adjust colors for syntax highlighting

## For LaTeX Equations

### Method 1: IguanaTeX Add-in

1.  Install [IguanaTeX](https://www.jonathanleroux.org/software/iguanatex/)
2.  In PowerPoint: Insert → IguanaTeX
3.  Enter your LaTeX code and it will render as an image

### Method 2: LaTeX to Image Conversion

1.  Write your equation in a LaTeX editor or online tool (Overleaf, LaTeX Base)
2.  Export as PNG/SVG/PDF
3.  Insert the image into PowerPoint

### Method 3: MathType (Commercial)

1.  Install MathType
2.  In PowerPoint: Insert → MathType Equation
3.  Supports LaTeX input and converts to editable equations

### Method 4: Office Built-in Equation Editor

1.  Insert → Equation
2.  While not LaTeX, it supports similar syntax for basic equations
3.  Use UnicodeMath or LaTeX-like input (depending on Office version)

## Tips for Better Results

- For code: Use a light background with dark text for better visibility
- For equations: Increase font size (18pt minimum for readability)
- Consider adding line numbers for code snippets
- Test your presentation on the actual projector/screen you'll use
- Keep animations simple when revealing code/equations
