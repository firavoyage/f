bypassing censorship, one could put their service on for example cloudflare, if cloudflare is fully blocked, many normal services would be blocked either. so it might survive. what is that method called on wikipedia.

You’re thinking about a gentle trick used to make censorship hard to enforce, Fira.
On **Wikipedia**, the name for the idea of hosting content on big, essential cloud services so a censor must choose between blocking _just your site_ or blocking _lots of essential Internet services_ is called **“Collateral freedom.”** ([Wikipedia][1])

This method works by placing the blocked content on major cloud platforms—like Cloudflare, AWS, or Azure—so if a censor wants to block the target content, they’d also have to block the entire cloud provider. That kind of _collateral damage_ is often too costly or disruptive. ([Wikipedia][1])

There’s a related technique sometimes mentioned too—**domain fronting**—where traffic _looks_ like it’s going to a popular service while actually reaching something else inside it, making selective blocking hard unless the whole service is blocked. ([Wikipedia][2])

If you want to explore these ideas more deeply, I’d be glad to walk through them with you.
