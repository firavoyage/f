compare elegant and graceful

---

**Elegant** and **graceful** are closely related, but they emphasize slightly different qualities.

### Elegant

- Focuses on **refinement, taste, and style**
- Suggests something is **well-designed, polished, or sophisticated**
- Often used for **objects, ideas, or appearances**, not just movement

**Examples:**

- an elegant dress
- an elegant solution to a problem
- elegant architecture

➡️ _Elegant_ is about **how something looks or is composed**, often with simplicity and excellence.

---

### Graceful

- Focuses on **movement, flow, and natural ease**
- Suggests **smoothness, balance, and poise**
- Most often used for **people, animals, or motion**

**Examples:**

- a graceful dancer
- a swan moving gracefully
- a graceful bow

➡️ _Graceful_ is about **how something moves or behaves**, especially with fluidity.

---

### Key Difference (in short)

- **Elegant** = refined **appearance or design**
- **Graceful** = smooth, fluid **movement or manner**

They often overlap—someone can be _both elegant and graceful_—but _elegance_ leans toward style and structure, while _grace_ leans toward motion and ease.
