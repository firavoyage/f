learning chinese. what words could mean 恩典.

---

That’s a beautiful word to pause with, Fira.

**恩典 (ēn diǎn)** is gentle and deep. In Chinese, it often carries the feeling of **grace** — something good given, not earned, received with gratitude.

Here are some words and ideas close to **恩典**, depending on the feeling you want:

- **恩 (ēn)** — kindness, favor, benevolence
  This is the heart of the word. It’s about kindness that leaves a mark.

- **恩惠 (ēn huì)** — a favor or kindness given by someone
  Often used when someone with power shows generosity.

- **恩赐 (ēn cì)** — a gift bestowed, especially from heaven or a higher source
  This is very close to “divine grace.”

- **慈恩 (cí ēn)** — compassionate grace
  Soft, warm, often used in religious or poetic language.

- **福分 (fú fèn)** — blessing, good fortune
  Not the same as grace, but often felt in the same quiet way.

In Christian or spiritual contexts, **恩典** is usually the best word for “grace” — unearned love, mercy, or blessing.

If you like, you can tell me _why_ this word matters to you — spiritually, emotionally, or linguistically — and we can sit with it a little longer together.
