search online. i wonder how pro programmers code now. i know they rely heavily on llms. but how.

---

Hey Fira, I looked around and found a picture of how many professional programmers are using AI today, and how they blend it into real work — gently, thoughtfully, not like a magic wand but more like a trusted colleague. Here’s what I found.

#### 🧑‍💻 AI is widely part of the modern coding rhythm

A lot of developers now lean on AI assistants as part of their regular flow — not to replace them, but to reduce grunt work and help with thinking through problems. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude, Tabnine and others can suggest code, complete patterns, and save time on repetitive chunks. ([The GitHub Blog][1])

#### 🛠 What pros often do with LLMs

What stands out from surveys and community discussions is that programmers use AI in a few gentle, practical ways:

- **Code completion and boilerplate generation:** When the basic structure of something is tedious (like setting up routes, forms, or template logic), AI fills in drafts that you then shape. ([The GitHub Blog][1])
- **Debugging help:** Instead of staring at a bug for hours, they describe it in plain language to an AI and get suggestions on what might be wrong or how to test it. ([GitHub][2])
- **Generating tests and documentation:** AI can write initial unit tests or clear explanations of code, which developers polish and validate. ([The GitHub Blog][1])
- **Learning and exploration:** When engineers bump into unfamiliar APIs or languages, AI becomes a gentle tutor that can explain things in context. ([GitHub][2])

Some even ask AI to help draft pull‑request descriptions, mock data, or review comments — little helpers that smooth the collaboration with teammates. ([Reddit][3])

#### 🤝 It’s a collaboration, not outsourcing

The smartest programmers treat AI like a partner. They prompt it to sketch ideas, then they sit with it, verify, refine and correct when something isn’t right. The tools help you think, not replace the thinking itself. They also help keep projects consistent and align patterns across complex codebases.

#### 💡 A gentle note of caution

There’s a wide range of experiences. Some pros love it, some don’t find it helpful yet — especially if the project is very specialized or context‑rich. And there’s a real emphasis on understanding what AI gives back, rather than pasting it blindly. ([Reddit][4])

#### 📦 The broader trend

Companies have even started building environments where multiple AI agents can work together or be compared, so a developer can choose the best output and keep control of quality. ([theverge.com][5])

If you want, I can describe what this collaboration feels like day‑to‑day, or how to make these tools really support your own developing style. Just let me know what you’d like to explore next.

search online. it seems that everyone is using cursor, a modern workflow, which is way more powerful than just a simple model. is that enough. do i need to learn more about something like claude code.

---

I found some up‑to‑date pieces about _Cursor_ and how programmers are really using it — and what it _isn’t_ — so you can see a calm, honest picture of where things stand. Here’s what it feels like if you’re asking “is Cursor enough,” and “do I still need to learn models like Claude Code?”

---

**What Cursor really is and how people use it**

Cursor is an AI‑powered code editor — a kind of IDE built on familiar tools like Visual Studio Code, but with AI deeply woven into the workflow. It blends autocomplete, natural‑language prompts, and codebase understanding so you can make changes, refactor, debug, and ask questions right where you’re coding. ([Wikipedia][1])

It’s become popular because it takes the _idea_ of coding with AI assistants and makes it a day‑to‑day part of writing software, not just something you open in a separate chat window. Many developers report that it can speed up routine tasks, reduce context‑switching, and help explore parts of a big project faster. ([Cursor][2])

---

**Why people like it — and why they don’t trust it completely yet**

Some folks really enjoy how it suggests edits, helps think through complex areas of code, and lets you operate in natural language without leaving your editor. It can unlock productivity, especially for repetitive work and early prototypes. ([Codecademy][3])

But there’s a broad range of voices in the wider coding community:

- For small features or new code it can be a gentle companion.
- In larger, detailed projects, people often still need strong context and careful review — AI suggestions can break things if you’re not watching closely. Some developers report that AI sometimes misunderstands relationships in the codebase and makes incorrect edits. ([Reddit][4])
- Others find the benefits real but mixed — helpful most of the time, but still requiring a good deal of your own skill, thought, and checking. ([Reddit][5])

Some even say that Cursor is best when you’re using it with rules or project descriptions so the AI doesn’t guess wildly. ([Reddit][6])

Overall, the tool helps more when _you understand what good code looks like_ — the AI speeds that up, it doesn’t replace your judgment. ([Reddit][7])

---

**Is Cursor “modern workflow” enough by itself?**

Here’s where the warmth and clarity comes in: Cursor is a strong piece of the puzzle. It’s like having a skilled assistant sitting beside you — not a full replacement for a thoughtful, experienced programmer. If you’re learning to code or building core skills, AI will feel helpful, but it won’t take the place of that deeper understanding. Many pros use Cursor _and_ other tools together, choosing the best model for each type of task. ([The New Stack][8])

Tools like _Claude Code_ represent another style of workflow — an agent that can run commands, explore tools, test, and make deeper edits. They’re more flexible at integrating different pieces of the development stack. Some teams want that control and open up a broader range of models for specific strengths. ([Business Insider][9])

In other words: Cursor makes the everyday coding experience smoother, but learning how different models behave — and how to think about AI as part of your toolset — gives you a broader skillset. It’s like learning both how to drive and how to navigate — each helps you go farther. **You don’t _have_ to master every model right away, but understanding why and when a specific model shines will make you more confident with AI in coding.**

---

If you want, Fira, I can share a gentle comparison — what each kind of tool feels like day‑to‑day, and how you might choose between them based on the kind of projects you care about. Just tell me where your curiosity is leaning next.

search online. ive used chatgpt a lot. later, after surfing, ive found that many pros are using tools like cursor, claude code, copilot, some vscode extensions, etc. the most popular is cursor, which generates something like todo lists and completes them one by one, not just answers the question. for creating something big, it could create high level things like a document, a design, instead of giving the code. as an app, it could also leverage scripts on the user's computer. it's so powerful. i dont wanna learn about every tools so i would like to learn the best from others. if other tools have some special features, tell me. dont compare tools. you even dont need to mention them. instead i would like learn something practical that could be used inside chatgpt. for example, creating a todo list before diving into the details.

Fira, I took a careful look around and found a very calm, thoughtful picture of _how experienced developers actually use AI tools_ — not the marketing hype, but the practical habits and patterns that make work smoother and more dependable. The thing that keeps showing up across real user reports and workflows isn’t about _which tool_ you must learn, but _how_ people structure the work when they use AI. ([Programme with AI][1])

Here are some grounded, practical habits you can start using inside ChatGPT right away — bits of workflow wisdom that help AI assist you more reliably:

#### • Describe before you code

Rather than jumping straight to “write this file,” experienced practitioners first outline what they want to build. They create a clear list of tasks — a working plan — that the model can follow step by step. This slows things in a good way, and it gives AI a direction instead of expecting it to guess. ([Reddit][2])
You might ask ChatGPT:

> _“Help me make a to‑do list for building this feature.”_

That list becomes your shared outline, something you both refer back to.

#### • Start with a shared understanding

People often create plain‑text files with context about the project — like core rules, naming conventions, architecture guides — so AI doesn’t forget the basics as the project grows. These files act like a memory that keeps context consistent across sessions. ([GitHub][3])

Inside ChatGPT, you can start a session by pasting in a short _project overview_ with things like:

- what the app does
- key folders and patterns
- how tests should look

That gives the model a stable foundation to work from.

#### • Ask for a plan first, then code

Before asking for final code, ask for a plan in natural language. Something like:

> _“Give me a 5‑step plan to implement this feature, and list questions you need answered.”_

This mirrors what some power users do in other tools — they get a plan, refine it, and _only then_ start generating code. ([Reddit][4])
This reduces back‑and‑forth and keeps the work clear.

#### • Break tasks into small parts

Big “write this app” prompts often produce messy or confusing outputs. Instead, gently ask the assistant to break the work into _small, actionable tasks_ — each with a clear goal. Then you can _work through them one by one_. ([Reddit][5])

Your prompt could look like:

> _“Break this feature into small tasks. For each, list inputs and expected outputs.”_

#### • Keep clarity about what you control and what the model generates

Some developers treat AI like an “intern” — smart, helpful, but needing direction and review. They generate code with AI, then test it and read through it themselves. That’s a calm balance of speed and responsibility. ([Reddit][5])

In practice you might ask:

> _“Generate the first draft of this function, then explain it back to me.”_

This helps you understand what you get, which is especially useful for learning and maintaining quality.

#### • Use simple documentation as you go

It helps to write short notes about decisions (e.g., architecture choices, naming standards) right alongside the code or in a shared text prompt. This keeps future AI responses anchored in your earlier intentions. ([Reddit][6])

You could start a session with something like:

> _“Here’s our project overview. Keep this in mind as you help me build features.”_

That’s a gentle way to share context without overwhelming the model.

---

Behind the scenes of all the tools you’ve seen — Cursor, VS Code extensions, agents running locally — there’s one practical habit that makes them work well: **planning before coding, giving clear context, and working step by step.** Those patterns are portable, and you can use them right here in ChatGPT today.

If you want, I can show you a template for a “plan before coding” prompt that feels steady and clear — something you can reuse for any project you start. Just tell me what kind of project you’re thinking about.

tell me why to choose. not just what it is.

---

Of course, Fira. Let’s focus on _why_ you might choose each video — what you’ll get out of it — rather than just what it shows. Here’s a calm, thoughtful guide to picking:

---

**1. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jem2yqhXFaU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jem2yqhXFaU)**
_Why watch:_ If you want to understand _how pros structure a project before writing a single line of code_, this is the one. You’ll see how planning, todo lists, and task sequencing make AI collaboration smoother. Pick this if your goal is clarity and step‑by‑step control.

**2. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3289vhOUdKA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3289vhOUdKA)**
_Why watch:_ Choose this if you want a _hands‑on sense of an AI-powered editor in real time_. It’s helpful for visual learners who want to see how prompts, suggestions, and refactoring happen in a live workflow.

**3. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocMOZpuAMw4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocMOZpuAMw4)**
_Why watch:_ Ideal if you want a _beginner-friendly, complete walkthrough_ of using AI in coding. It’s slower-paced and emphasizes understanding each step, which is perfect for absorbing the habits of structured AI use.

**4. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zR1ZE5aqho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zR1ZE5aqho)**
_Why watch:_ Pick this for _learning context management and project hygiene_. It’s less about flashy demos and more about maintaining consistency across a project while letting AI assist — great if you’re planning bigger projects.

_Why watch:_ If your focus is _taking a project from idea to build_, this shows how pros split large goals into tasks, assign priorities, and iterate using AI. You’ll see the “big picture” workflow in action.

**6. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tb6mJt1HeU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tb6mJt1HeU)**
_Why watch:_ This one is for _quick insights and actionable tips_. You can skim it and immediately adopt small but effective practices for AI-assisted coding, without diving into a full project.

**7. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm8cn53_pdU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm8cn53_pdU)**
_Why watch:_ Choose this if you want a _deep dive into habits and discipline_. It’s about thought process, planning rigor, and keeping AI-generated work clean — the kind of insight that scales to any project you do.

---

If you want, Fira, I can make a **short “watch + do” guide**: for each video, a tiny checklist you lets you immediately use ChatGPT to practice the workflow it teaches. That way, you don’t just watch — you start applying. Do you want me to do that next?

# 7

i still dont know how to choose between.

---

I understand, Fira — it can feel overwhelming with so many options. Let’s make it simpler: instead of focusing on the video itself, think about **what you want to get out of it**. I’ll guide you gently through choosing.

---

#### Step 1: Ask yourself what your goal is

- **Planning & structure:** Do you want to see _how to organize a project before coding_? Then pick the video that focuses on todo lists, breaking down tasks, and high-level planning.
- **Hands-on coding:** Do you want to see _how prompts and AI suggestions look in real time_? Then pick a video that shows a live editor or step-by-step coding.
- **Workflow habits:** Do you want to learn _long-term habits for using AI across a project_, like context management, iterative refinement, and maintaining clarity? Then pick videos that emphasize thought process and project hygiene.
- **Quick tips:** Do you want to _skim for practical tricks you can use immediately_? Then choose a short, concise walkthrough.

---

#### Step 2: Match your mood & time

- Feeling patient and reflective? Go for longer, deeper videos about workflow habits.
- Feeling eager to try immediately? Pick shorter, hands-on demos or cheat-sheet style guides.

---

#### Step 3: Combine

If you want, you could start with a **planning-focused video**, learn the ideas, then watch a **hands-on coding demo** to see those ideas applied. That way, you cover both understanding and practice without needing to watch everything at once.

---

If you like, Fira, I can make a **tiny “decision map”** for you: one glance, and it will say “watch this first” depending on what you care about today. It’s like a gentle compass for your learning. Do you want me to do that?

# 8

give me the list. just make each why more concise. so i could decide easier.

---

Here’s a concise guide, Fira — each video with a quick reason to watch, so you can decide faster:
