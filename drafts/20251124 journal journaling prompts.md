**Tips for Effective Journaling:**

- **No Pressure:** Your journal doesn't have to be perfect. Spelling, grammar, and coherence don't matter. Just write.
- **Be Honest:** This is for your eyes only. The more truthful you are, the more you'll benefit.
- **Consistency Over Length:** Writing for 5 minutes every day is better than for an hour once a month.
- **Don't Know Where to Start?** Begin with "Right now, I feel..." or "What's on my mind is..." and let it flow.

Happy journaling
