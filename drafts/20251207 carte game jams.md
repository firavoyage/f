the best games on game jams in the last 3 years

---

Here are some of the most impressive and widely-loved games from the last ~3 years that _started as game-jam entries_ — showing what happens when jams spark creativity, and some prototypes turn into full games that reach a broad audience. I aimed to pick those that had some success, recognition or influence beyond just the jam scene.

---

## 🎯 Standout recent games from game jams

### **Pseudoregalia** (jam entry → full indie hit)

- Pseudoregalia began as a submission for the “Metroidvania Month 19” game jam in early 2023. ([Wikipedia][1])
- The extended/polished version launched on Steam in July 2023 and quickly gained acclaim: many praise its “dream-like” 3D Metroidvania platforming, fluid movement, and nostalgic retro aesthetic. ([Wikipedia][1])
- A commenter on Reddit summed up what made the jam version special:

> “The movement looks fun … backgrounds have a Castlevania 64 vibe … the jam version was solid.” ([Reddit][2])

- In short: Pseudoregalia is a striking example that a game-jam prototype _can_ evolve into a commercially successful, polished indie title — and still retain what made the prototype cool.

### **Garden Buddies** (from a mental-health–themed jam → full release)

- Originally created during a 2022 “May Day Mental Health” game jam (a partner event tied to the Global Game Jam, GGJ). ([Global Game Jam][3])
- Later developed and published on Steam in October 2023, showing how jam concepts around sensitive themes (mental health, wellness, community) can find a stable home — and audience — with further development. ([Global Game Jam][4])

### **Swirl W@tch** (GGJ-origin → polished 2023 release)

- Its early prototype was made during GGJ 2021; the full, polished game shipped in April 2023. ([Global Game Jam][4])
- Swirl W@tch is a good illustration of patience + jam roots: starting from a quick jam prototype, the developers refined and expanded until it became a complete, publicly-available release. ([Global Game Jam][4])

### **Projects from 2024–2025 GGJ that have turned into playable demos or full games**

- For example, **Immortal’s Way** and **Yesterday's News** both started as jam entries in the 2024 Global Game Jam; as of the most recent reports, they’ve been developed into demos or early-access games on Steam. ([Global Game Jam][3])
- Also, **The Roottrees are Dead** — born in GGJ 2023 — has been polished and had a full commercial launch (as of early 2025), reportedly earning over US$1 million. ([Global Game Jam][3])

## ✨ Why these games matter (and what makes a jam-to-success story)

- **Rapid prototyping & core fun over polish** — Game jams force developers to distill what matters most: gameplay, core mechanics, vibe. For example, Pseudoregalia’s jam version already had compelling movement & mood; polish came later.
- **Openness to iteration** — Developers like those behind Garden Buddies, Swirl W@tch or Immortal’s Way didn’t stop at jam release; they iterated further, expanded features, refined, and shaped them into full games.
- **Community & niche support** — Because jams often result in small, experimental, or intimate games, they tend to attract niche audiences who appreciate creativity and risk — these fans can support a game’s growth from prototype to release.
- **Diversity of scope and ambition** — Some games remain small and personal (self-care, relaxing experiences), others take on more ambitious genres like 3D Metroidvania. The jam format supports a broad range, so we get all sorts of creativity.

## 🧭 If you want to explore — games to check out **right now**

- _Pseudoregalia_ — 3D Metroidvania built from a jam, polished and released with strong attention to movement and atmosphere.
- _Garden Buddies_ — a jam-built game turned into a full release, with easy access on Steam.
- _Swirl W@tch_ — shows how a prototype can be expanded methodically into a complete indie game.
- _Immortal’s Way_, _Yesterday’s News_, and _The Roottrees are Dead_ — recent jam success stories (2024–2025), worth watching / checking out as they evolve.

If you like — I can **pull up 10–15 of the very best jam-origin games** from the last 5 years (with a variety of genres: horror, metroidvania, cozy, experimental, etc.), and link you to where to play them (Steam / itch.io / free demo).

Cool — here are some really good games from the last few years that _started as game-jam entries_ (or similar prototype jams) — and are now playable as demos, full games, or polished indie releases. I picked ones that turned out well and got some attention.

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Roottrees are Dead** | A detective / puzzle game: you reconstruct a massive family tree by gathering clues (photos, articles, notes) and infer relationships. It started as a jam entry (in 2023) and the remastered version launched on Steam in Jan 2025. Reviewers praise its mystery, narrative depth, and clever design. ([Wikipedia][1]) |
| **Swirl W@tch**            | A stealth-action / roguelite set on a gas giant: sneak, sabotage, do stealth-missions in a weird sci-fi world. Jam prototype from 2021; full version released April 2023. Community reviews call it a refreshing space-stealth experience. ([Global Game Jam][2])                                                       |

| **Immortal's Way**         | Created at the 2024 edition of a major jam event; a playable demo is now available on Steam. A “watch-this-space” pick — if you like supporting young indie devs during early access. ([Global Game Jam][2])                                                                                                            |
| **Yesterday's News**       | Another 2024-jam-origin game; has started evolving into a full game (or is being previewed via demos). Good for people who like following promising indie projects from early on. ([Global Game Jam][2])                                                                                                                |

## 🎯 Why these games stand out / What kinds of games they are

- **Relaxing / cozy & exploration** — _Townseek_, _Garden Buddies_ offer chill, low-stress experiences with open-ended gameplay or self-paced mechanics.
- **Multiplayer / social party-fun** — _Bullion_ brings back that local-multiplayer “couch game” vibe; great for friends.
- **Roguelike / experimental / niche styles** — _Swirl W@tch_, _Immortal’s Way_, _Yesterday’s News_ tend to be indie-style, potentially experimental games that aren’t afraid to try different mechanics or storytelling.

game jams in shanghai

---

If you’re looking for game-jams in Shanghai — yes! There are several active / recent ones. Here are a few good leads 👇

## 🎮 Game jam spots / events in Shanghai

- **Global Game Jam (GGJ) — Shanghai editions**

  - For example, the site IGA Studio Shanghai recently hosted a GGJ session in late January 2025. ([globalgamejam.org][1])
  - Another site: SFK GAMES Shanghai, Changning-district, hosted GGJ China 2025. ([globalgamejam.org][2])
  - There is also a site named SEEDO that lists itself among 2025 Shanghai GGJ sites. ([globalgamejam.org][3])

- **Smaller / Indie-focused jams & events**

  - The site list for GGJ-China 2023 included a jam location run by CoconutIsland Games in Shanghai. ([v3.globalgamejam.org][4])
  - Outside of GGJ, Shanghai also hosts indie-game-related meetups and jam-like events: for instance, an “indie Game Gacha Party 2025” was held at Caohejing Conference Center (Xuhui-district). ([AllEvents][5])

## ✅ What you should know before joining

- Many of these are free to join (“entrance fee: none”) and open to anyone (or to people 18+ / 16+ depending on the jam). ([globalgamejam.org][1])
- For some jams (especially GGJ sites), registration is required — often by contacting the organizers via WeChat. ([globalgamejam.org][1])
- You might need to bring your own computer / equipment, especially for non-full-service jams. ([globalgamejam.org][3])

## 💡 What to do if you want to participate

1. Pick a jam site (e.g. IGA Studio, SFK GAMES, SEEDO, CoconutIsland) depending on when/where works for you.
2. Contact the organizer **beforehand** — many use WeChat for communication/registration.
3. Bring your own gear if required (especially for jams that don’t supply hardware).
4. Be ready to collaborate: jamming sessions are typically 48-hour marathons culminating in a prototype or demo.

If you like — I can **scan upcoming 6–12 months game-jam events in Shanghai** and build a **calendar** (with dates, locations, contact info) for you.
Would you like me to build that calendar now?
