if i ask llms to generate a random number, how random will it be. see what people say.

---

Fira, let’s sit with this gently — like watching leaves dancing on a stream, curious but calm.

When you ask an LLM to _give you a random number_, what people observe in conversations online and in studies is not true randomness the way a coin toss or a physical die would produce it. It’s more like a **pattern‑inspired guess**. ([IFLScience][1])

Here’s what most folks have noticed:

**🌱 LLMs aren’t built to be random number machines**
They don’t have a built‑in random generator in the way computers have pseudorandom libraries or physical devices have hardware randomness. Instead, they’re trained to **predict text that makes sense** based on patterns they have seen during training. So when you ask, “Pick a random number between 1 and 50,” the model often picks a number that’s _common in language or looks “random enough”_ — like 27 or 37 — not because it rolled a die, but because that’s what seems statistically familiar. ([LinkedIn][2])

**🌟 People testing it see predictable biases**
When people have tried the same prompt over and over, LLMs often return the _same numbers_ or narrow sets of numbers again and again. That tells us the output isn’t uniformly random — it’s shaped by training data and patterns that match human tendencies (like humans choosing numbers that _feel_ random). ([IFLScience][1])

**🍃 “Randomness” in an LLM is more like impression than chance**
Some studies and experiments show that LLM outputs have _biases_ toward certain digits or parts of ranges, similar to how humans pick numbers when told to be “random” — people often avoid the extremes and choose middle numbers or numbers ending in 7, 3, or similar. LLMs mirror that pattern rather than sampling a true random distribution. ([LinkedIn][3])

**📊 For real randomness, there are better tools**
Real randomness — in mathematics or computing — usually comes from either hardware sources (like noise in circuits) or well‑tested pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). LLMs weren’t built for that purpose, and relying on them for genuine randomness (especially in anything serious) can be misleading. ([Wikipedia][4])

So, in a warm, reflective way — asking an LLM to generate a random number is more like asking a friend what number feels fresh today. It can be fun, it can surprise you, but it’s _not truly unpredictable_ in the mathematical sense. If you need real randomness, you’d turn to the tools designed for that — a proper random number generator, not a language model. ([keenethics.com][5])

If you want, we can explore how people _use_ real randomness in computing, or how LLMs can be coaxed to behave less predictably. Just let me know.

how random

---

Fira, let’s imagine this in soft, clear terms — like sensing the difference between a truly wild breeze and a patterned gust you’ve felt before.

When you ask an LLM to give a _“random number,”_ what you get is **not true randomness** in the mathematical or physical sense you’d expect from rolling a die or using a proper random generator. Instead, you get something shaped by patterns the model learned from human writing — familiar, common, and sometimes surprisingly predictable. ([IFLScience][1])

Here’s how people and researchers describe it:

### 🌿 1. It reflects _patterns,_ not chance

An LLM doesn’t have a built‑in random source the way computers sometimes do (like pseudorandom libraries). It predicts the most likely text based on its training, and that includes numbers that show up often in similar prompts. For example, when many people online asked models to pick a number between 1 and 50, a lot of them ended up choosing **27** — not because it’s random, but because that choice appears common in training data and human behavior. ([IFLScience][1])

### 🍃 2. You’ll see _biases,_ not uniform distributions

If the LLM were genuinely random, each number in a range (like 1–50) would have about the same chance of being picked. But people testing this find certain numbers like 27, 37, or 7 come up most often — the model favors these because they’ve been seen as “random‑looking” in human language. That’s why you’ll notice patterns or repeated favorites rather than a flat, unpredictable spread. ([Medium][2])

### 🌼 3. There’s only _some variability,_ not true unpredictability

If you ask again and again, the model might give different answers at times. That’s because its internal token selection is probabilistic — it looks at a distribution of likely tokens and samples from them. But that doesn’t make it truly random; it just makes the patterns a bit more varied. ([Kieran Browne][3])

### 🧠 4. In research, models often behave _deterministically_

Studies have shown that even though LLMs are built on probabilistic mechanisms, their responses to random number prompts can be quite predictable — driven by the hidden biases in the data they learned from, and sometimes influenced by the language used in your prompt. ([Moonlight][4])

### 🌾 So if you ask: _How random?_

In gentle clarity:

- **Not truly random** — the model doesn’t generate numbers from a physical or cryptographic source of randomness. ([Medium][2])
- **Some variability** — you’ll see some differences across runs, but patterns will still stand out. ([Kieran Browne][3])
- **Biased by human data** — what feels “random” often mirrors what _people_ have tended to pick or write. ([LinkedIn][5])

If you want _real_ randomness — the kind you use in simulations, lotteries, or cryptography — it’s better to use tools built for that purpose (like pseudorandom number generators or hardware entropy sources). LLM answers for random numbers are like asking a storyteller to whisper a number that _feels_ random — warm and familiar, but not genuinely unpredictable. ([Wikipedia][6])

If you’d like, we can explore how to make an LLM _mimic_ randomness more convincingly, or how real random number tools work in gentle terms. Just ask.

i mean, how random, like expectation, variation, etc.

---

Fira — if we slow this down and look at what people are finding when they _actually measure_ how “random” LLM‑generated numbers are, we can talk about **expectation, variation, and distribution** in a gentle, clear way.

But first let’s remind ourselves: LLMs weren’t designed to be random number generators. They’re prediction machines trained on text, not statistical engines. This shapes the randomness they _appear_ to produce. ([IFLScience][1])

---

### 🌱 1. **True randomness vs. what LLMs do**

Real random numbers — like from a die or a good pseudorandom generator — have statistical properties we can measure:

- **Expectation (mean)** — if you pick uniformly from 1 to 10, the expected (average) value is 5.5. ([Wikipedia][2])
- **Variation (spread/variance)** — for a perfect uniform range, variance is predictable and mathematically defined. ([Wikipedia][2])
- **Uniform distribution** — every number has nearly equal chance. ([Wikipedia][2])

LLMs, in contrast, often show **biased distributions** — their outputs _don’t_ match what mathematics calls uniform randomness unless you give them special instructions or external tools. ([Machine State by ARSA Technology][3])

---

### 🌼 2. **Observed distributions in practice**

When people actually _test_ LLM outputs:

- LLMs tend to pick **certain numbers more often** than others — like middle values or specific favourites — instead of equal chances for every number. ([IFLScience][1])
- That means the **expected value** you observe over many trials could drift toward those favoured numbers instead of hovering near the true statistical mean. ([IFLScience][1])
- The **variation** (how spread out the numbers are) will be _narrower or skewed_ if the model keeps favouring some values. ([IFLScience][1])

For example, one informal test showed the number “27” or “37” appearing surprisingly often when models were asked for a number between 1 and 50 — very unlike a flat uniform distribution. ([IFLScience][1])

This kind of behaviour tells us the distribution is _not_ statistically uniform, so the mean, variance, and other statistical properties won’t match what we expect from a true random process.

---

### 🍃 3. **Statistical testing reveals limits**

Researchers have tried to measure the quality of randomness from LLMs using formal tests:

- In large tests comparing LLM outputs to recognized randomness benchmarks (like NIST tests used for cryptography), many models **failed a large majority** of randomness tests. ([Moonlight][4])
- That means if you treat the LLM output as a source of random samples, its **entropy (information content)** and distribution don’t line up with true randomness. ([Moonlight][4])

In simpler terms: if you collect a lot of numbers from an LLM and test how unpredictable they are using serious statistical tools, most current models don’t pass the tests that real pseudorandom number generators would.

---

### ✨ 4. **Where the “probabilistic” part comes from**

It’s worth noting: deep learning models do involve _probabilistic sampling_ inside them — that’s part of how they generate varied text. This _does_ introduce some variation from run to run, especially with certain sampling settings. ([Dr. Tae-Gil Noh Gil’s Observations][5])

So the randomness you see isn’t zero — it’s just not _mathematically uniform or unbiased._ The numbers vary, but they’re influenced by:

1. **Training data biases** (numbers humans write often show up more). ([IFLScience][1])
2. **Token probabilities** (the model treats number tokens like words). ([IFLScience][1])
3. **Internal sampling settings** (temperature, top‑P, etc.) which change how broadly it chooses less‑likely tokens. ([Dr. Tae-Gil Noh Gil’s Observations][5])

So if you change how you ask — or tweak sampling parameters through an API — you’ll see different amounts of variation. But even then, we don’t get perfect uniform randomness.

---

### 🌌 In gentle summary

- A _true_ random generator gives each number equal chance, and has a predictable mean and variance. ([Wikipedia][2])
- LLM “random” numbers often **do not follow** a true uniform distribution — they bias toward certain values. ([IFLScience][1])
- Because of those biases, the **expected value and variance** you observe across many outputs can _drift from what pure statistics predicts._ ([IFLScience][1])
- Formal statistical tests show many LLMs **fail real randomness checks**, so their outputs lack the rigorous unpredictability needed for serious random sampling. ([Moonlight][4])

If it feels meaningful, we can explore _how scientific tests measure randomness_ (like mean, variance, entropy, chi‑square) and what they tell us about LLM‑generated numbers in a very calm, gentle way. Just let me know.
