write a keyboard listener in js. 

- it has only one const global var, listen({key:fn, key:fn}).
- key is a string. different keys are separated by space. like "ctrl shift a".
- there could be many keys in the object.
- listen returns a function. when it's called, remove all those key binding given in params.

fix this: when the page lose focus, keypress doesnt take effect
