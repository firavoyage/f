I’m here, Fira.
Calm, present, and listening.

Whenever you’re ready, we can begin.

# 1

If I grab my hair could I pull myself into the air. Explain with highschool physics

---

That’s a lovely question, Fira. It sounds simple, but it touches a deep idea in physics.

Short answer: **no, you can’t lift yourself into the air by pulling your own hair.**

Now let’s see why, using high‑school physics.

---

### 1. Forces come in pairs

This is **Newton’s Third Law**:

> _For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction._

When you pull **up** on your hair, your hair pulls **down** on your hand with the same force.

But here’s the key part:
Both your hand **and** your hair are part of _you_.

So all the forces are happening **inside your own body**.

---

### 2. Internal forces can’t move your center of mass

Physics cares a lot about something called the **center of mass** — roughly the “average position” of all your mass.

When you pull your hair:

- Your arms pull up
- Your scalp gets pulled up
- Your body feels some tension

But because every force is internal, they cancel out overall.

There is **no net external upward force**, so your center of mass does not accelerate upward.

And without an upward acceleration, you don’t leave the ground.

---

### 3. What _would_ be needed to lift yourself

To rise into the air, you must push **down on something external**:

- The ground (like jumping)
- Air (like a helicopter or bird)
- A rope attached to the ceiling

In those cases, the external object pushes back on you, and _that_ upward force can lift you.

Your hair is not external. It comes along with you.

---

### 4. A simple way to remember

Trying to lift yourself by your hair is like:

- Trying to pick yourself up by your own shirt
- Trying to stand up by pulling on your legs

It feels like effort, but physics says: **effort alone isn’t enough — direction and interaction matter.**

---

So the gentle wisdom here is this:
You cannot rise by pulling on yourself alone. You rise by pushing against the world.

And that’s true in physics… and in life too.

If you’d like, we can explore a fun twist on this idea, or look at a similar question that _does_ work.

# 2

Why is there no net external upward force. What is that

---

Ah, yes, Fira — this is the heart of it. Let’s unpack it slowly.

---

### 1. What “net external force” means

A **force** is a push or pull.

- **External force** → comes from _outside your body_.
- **Internal force** → comes from _inside your body_, between your own parts.

Your body only moves upward if **there’s a net external force upward**, meaning the forces from outside your body don’t cancel each other out.

---

### 2. Why pulling your hair isn’t external

When you grab your hair and pull:

- Your hand pulls upward on your hair. ✅
- Your hair pulls downward on your hand. ✅

Those two forces **cancel each other out** because they’re acting _within your body_. Physics calls this an **internal force**.

No matter how hard you pull, the total push from outside your body is **still zero** — the ground is holding you down, the air is around you, and nothing else is pushing upward.

---

### 3. A simple analogy

Imagine you have a rope tied around your waist. If you try to lift yourself by pulling on the rope **that’s tied to you**, you just tug on yourself — nothing moves.

But if the rope is tied to the ceiling, pulling on it creates a real upward **external force**, and now you can rise.

---

### 4. Bottom line

- **Internal forces**: cancel inside your body → no net movement
- **External forces**: push or pull from outside → can change your motion

So when you pull your own hair, all the forces are internal. There’s **no net external upward force**, which is just a fancy way of saying: _nothing from outside is actually lifting you_.

---

If you want, I can draw a little picture showing all the forces — it makes this idea really click. Do you want me to?

# 3

How do you separate internal and external in physics, not by feeling or intuition

---

Ah, Fira, now we’re stepping into the precise language of physics — not just intuition. Let’s take it slowly.

---

### 1. Definition in physics

In mechanics, we separate forces into **internal** and **external** based on **what object they act on**:

- **Internal force**: a force **one part of a system exerts on another part of the same system**.
- **External force**: a force **exerted on the system by something outside it**.

The key is defining your **system** clearly. That’s the formal rule.

---

### 2. Choosing a system

Let’s take your hair example:

- System = **your body**

  - Hair, scalp, arms, torso, legs = all part of the system

- Forces:

  - Hand pulling hair = internal (hand → hair)
  - Hair pulling hand = internal (hair → hand)
  - Ground pushing feet = external (ground → body)
  - Air pushing body slightly = external (air → body)

So once the system is defined, anything inside is **internal**, anything outside is **external**.

---

### 3. Why internal forces cancel

Newton’s Third Law says:

> Internal forces come in equal-and-opposite pairs.

For example, your hand pulls your hair upward with 50 N; your hair pulls your hand downward with 50 N. These **cancel in terms of the total force on the system’s center of mass**, so they cannot accelerate you upward.

Mathematically, if you sum **all forces on the system**:

[
\sum \vec{F}*{\text{total}} = \sum \vec{F}*{\text{internal}} + \sum \vec{F}_{\text{external}}
]

The internal sum = 0 (because every internal force has an equal opposite), so:

[
\sum \vec{F}*{\text{total}} = \sum \vec{F}*{\text{external}}
]

This is why **only external forces move the center of mass**.

---

### 4. How physicists determine internal vs external without guessing

1. Define a system (body, object, car, planet, etc.)
2. Identify all forces acting on **parts of the system**
3. Ask: _Does this force come from inside the system or outside?_

   - Inside → internal
   - Outside → external

4. Only sum the **external forces** to see acceleration of the system as a whole.

---

If you like, Fira, I can draw a neat diagram with the body, the forces, and show why pulling your own hair can’t lift you. That picture usually makes this crystal clear. Do you want me to do that?

# 4

What if i pull extremely hard and my body is tough enough and won't break into parts

---

That’s a thoughtful push, Fira. Let’s stay precise and calm, and let physics answer it cleanly.

Even **if you pull extremely hard**,
even **if your body were perfectly tough and unbreakable**,
the answer does **not change**.

And here’s why — without intuition, just structure.

---

### 1. Strength does not change force classification

How _hard_ you pull only changes the **magnitude** of the forces, not their **type**.

- Hand pulling hair → internal force
- Hair pulling hand → internal force

Whether that force is weak or enormous, it is still **internal**, because both parts belong to the same system.

Physics does not care how strong you are.
It only cares **where the force comes from**.

---

### 2. Newton’s Second Law for a system

For any system:

[
\vec{F}*{\text{external}} = M \vec{a}*{\text{center of mass}}
]

This is exact. No loopholes.

So ask the precise question:

> Does pulling harder create an **external** upward force?

The answer is no.

You have only increased **internal tension**, not added a new force from outside the system.

So:

- External upward force = 0
- Acceleration of center of mass = 0

No lift occurs.

---

### 3. Why “not breaking” doesn’t help

You might think:

> “If nothing breaks, maybe the forces can add up.”

But internal forces **always cancel in pairs**, no matter how rigid or flexible the system is.

This is true for:

- Rigid bodies
- Elastic bodies
- Hypothetical indestructible bodies

Rigidity affects **shape**, not **center-of-mass motion**.

---

### 4. A clean thought experiment

Imagine a perfectly rigid box floating in space.

Inside the box is a person pulling on a rope tied to the inside wall.

They pull harder and harder.

What happens?

- Tension increases
- Internal stresses increase
- The box does **not** move

Why?
Because nothing outside the box is pushing it.

Your body pulling its own hair is the same structure.

---

### 5. The deep rule (this never breaks)

> **No system can accelerate its own center of mass using only internal forces.**

This is not a rule of biology.
Not a rule of strength.
Not a rule of materials.

It is a rule of **conservation of momentum**.

---

### 6. Quiet conclusion

Pulling harder only makes you strain more.
It does not create lift.

To rise, something **outside you** must be pushed downward.

That’s the still point of the physics.

If you’d like, next we can explore _why rockets work_, because they look like they violate this rule — but they don’t.

# 5

How do you define the system. What if I don't see my body as one system. Then internal might become external. With external force I could lift.

---

Ah, Fira… now we’re really getting into the subtle heart of physics. You’re thinking carefully. Let’s go step by step.

---

### 1. The system is **a choice, not a law**

In physics, you **define a system** first. It can be anything:

- Your whole body
- Your hand alone
- Your hair and arm together
- The entire Earth

Once you define it, “internal” vs. “external” is completely determined by that choice.

- Forces **between parts inside the system** → internal
- Forces **from outside the system** → external

So yes, if you choose a different system, the classification can change.

---

### 2. Re-framing the system

Suppose you say:

- System = “hair alone”
  Then:
- Your hand pulling the hair = **external** (because your hand is outside this new system)
- Hair pulling the scalp = internal

If you really could treat **part of your body** as “external,” in theory you could lift that part.

---

### 3. Why this doesn’t let you lift your whole body

You cannot escape reality:

- To lift your **whole body**, the system must include your whole body.
- Then all forces you apply **within yourself** are internal.
- No internal arrangement can lift the center of mass of the system.

Treating part of your body as “external” is just a **mental trick** — physics cares about **actual physical boundaries** and **real external forces**, not what you choose to call external.

---

### 4. Analogy

Think of a box floating in space:

- System = the box → pushing inside the box changes **internal stress**, box doesn’t move.
- System = just a block inside the box → forces from outside the block move it relative to the box.

You can move parts **relative to themselves**, but you **cannot move the center of mass of the whole system** without true external forces.

---

### 5. Deep insight

Physics is forgiving with your system choice, but the **laws themselves don’t change**.

- You can make internal forces appear external **only for a subsystem**
- But the center of mass of the **entire real object** (your body) still only moves if acted on by **true external forces**

So pulling your own hair:

- You can stretch, strain, deform, or tug parts
- But your **body’s overall center of mass** cannot rise — no lift occurs

---

If you like, Fira, I can draw a **diagram showing different system choices** and why no choice lets you lift yourself as a whole. It’s really clarifying visually.

Do you want me to do that?

# 6

I see. But what would happen if I pull hard while my body is tough enough

---

Yes. I hear what you’re asking now, Fira.
You’re no longer asking _whether you lift_ — you’re asking _what actually happens physically_ if nothing breaks.

Let’s answer that gently and precisely.

---

### 1. What forces exist when you pull very hard

If your body is tough enough and you pull hard on your hair:

- Your arms create **large tension** in your muscles
- Your hair and scalp experience **strong upward force**
- Your neck and spine experience **strong internal stress**

All of this is real. None of it is ignored by physics.

But every one of these forces is still **internal** to your body.

---

### 2. What motion is allowed

Internal forces _can_ cause:

- Deformation (stretching or compression)
- Redistribution of mass (your arms rise, shoulders lift slightly)
- Internal vibrations or oscillations

Internal forces **cannot** cause:

- Upward acceleration of your body’s center of mass
- Liftoff from the ground

So what you would see is **strain without lift**.

---

### 3. A clean mechanical picture

Imagine your body as a very stiff but flexible structure:

- Arms pull up
- Scalp pulls down
- Torso responds with internal tension

The structure “locks up” under stress.

Your feet still press on the ground with the same total downward force as before.

The ground still pushes up with the same normal force.

No imbalance appears.

---

### 4. What the ground feels

This is important.

Even while pulling hard:

- Your **weight on the ground does not decrease**
- The normal force from the ground stays equal to your weight

If it decreased, you would start to lift.

It doesn’t.

---

### 5. The quiet conclusion

If nothing breaks and you pull as hard as you like:

- You feel effort
- Your body tightens
- Internal stresses grow
- Your shape may change slightly

But you stay exactly where you are.

---

### 6. A deeper truth

Physics allows motion **within** you,
but not motion **of you**,
unless something outside you is involved.

That’s the still, unbendable rule.

If you want, Fira, next we can explore a case where something _inside_ seems to create lift — like rockets or falling cats — and see why they don’t actually violate this principle.
