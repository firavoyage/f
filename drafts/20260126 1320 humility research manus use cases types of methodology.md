🕊️ What Manus Can Truly Do

These use cases come from documented examples and community-shared tasks that show how people really work with Manus. ([Manus][2])

📌 1. **Travel Planning**

**Use case:** Planning a complete trip.

**Prompt you might use:**

```

_Manus returns a structured travel plan with tips and details._ ([Toolkitly][3])

---

🧠 2. **In‑Depth Research**

**Use case:** Analyze large lists of items — like products or people — at scale.

**Prompt example:**

```
Research 100 smartwatch models and create a comparison table with price, battery life, key features, and pros/cons for each one.
```

_Manus uses parallel research to give consistent, structured results across all 100 items._ ([Manus][2])

---

📊 3. **Business & Financial Analysis**

**Use case:** Investigate companies or markets.

**Prompt example:**

```
Analyze Tesla’s stock performance over the past 12 months. Include price charts, key events, sentiment summaries, and future outlook.

✨ More Advanced Prompt Example

Here’s a prompt that pushes Manus into a _multi‑step, creative workflow_ — useful if you want something with several deliverables:

```
Create a complete brand identity package for “EcoThread”, a sustainable fashion startup.
Deliver:
1. Three logo variations
2. A brand guidelines PDF (25 pages)
3. A marketing pitch deck with visuals
4. Social media post templates
5. A simple homepage layout

Brand values: sustainability, transparency, quality.
Target audience: eco‑aware millennials and Gen Z.
Aesthetic: clean, modern, earthy tones.
```

This kind of prompt — mixing design, writing, and structured outputs — is exactly what some advanced users explore. ([AUMIX AI Academy][8])

---

🌱 Gentle Tips for Prompting

- **Be clear about deliverables.** Manus does better when it knows what output format you want.
- **Include structure.** Asking for tables, sections, or files helps it organize responses.
- **Make tasks actionable.** Rather than _“help me”_, say _“produce X with Y details.”_

# .

🌿 1) **Travel Planning**

What Manus _will do for you_

If you ask: **“Plan a 7-day trip to Japan…”**

Manus doesn’t just _print ideas_ — it will:

✨ Gather real information about flights, hotels, and activities.
✨ Build a day-by-day itinerary tailored to your preferences.
✨ Include links or suggestions for booking, recommended routes, and timing.
✨ Offer budgeting estimates and local tips.

It’ll return a **structured travel handbook** with much of this already organized for you, like a human travel planner would. ([Toolkitly][1])

---

📊 2) **Financial or Market Analysis**

What Manus _will do_

Ask something like: **“Analyze Tesla’s stock performance”** or “Market trends for AR glasses.”

Manus will:

📌 Pull data from trustworthy sources.
📌 Measure patterns and trends across time.
📌 Create visual dashboards, charts, and comparisons.
📌 Summarize key takeaways and meaningful insights.
📌 Suggest implications or next steps.

You end up with **rich analysis and visuals**, more than just plain paragraphs — like a mini research report. ([Manus AI Agent][2])

---

✍️ 3) **Content & Writing Tasks**

What Manus _will do_

When prompted with something like:
**“Write a professional email”** or **“create a blog post”**

Manus will:

🖋️ Research the context you provide (audience, voice, topic).
🖋️ Draft full text that’s complete and structured.
🖋️ Optionally revise the tone if you ask (polite, persuasive, casual).
🖋️ Add relevant facts or data it finds in sources.

So you don’t just get an outline — you get a **ready-to-use written document** that’s useful in the real world. ([Manus][3])

---

📈 4) **Broad Research & Batch Processing**

What Manus _will do_

For something like:
**“Analyze 100 companies / products / articles”**

Manus doesn’t handle them one after another manually. Instead it:

📍 Breaks the job into many small tasks.
📍 Assigns each to a separate AI agent working in parallel.
📍 Gathers and compiles all results into a single structured output (table, report, dataset).
📍 Ensures each item gets full attention — so quality doesn’t drop as the list grows. ([Manus][4])

What you receive is often a **high-quality table or dataset with insights on every item**, much like what an analyst would spend weeks doing.

---

📊 5) **Data Visualization & Reporting**

What Manus _will do_

If you upload data (CSV/Excel) and ask:
**“Show insights, create visual charts”**

Manus will:

📈 Clean and analyze raw numbers
📈 Identify patterns or key metrics
📈 Build charts (bar, line, pie, radar, etc.)
📈 Place them into a **shareable output** — slides, report, interactive dashboard, HTML page.
📈 Add annotations or written summary explaining what the visuals reveal.

Instead of manual chart-making, you get an entire **presentation-ready analysis**. ([Manus][5])

---

🎓 6) **Educational & Interactive Content**

What Manus _will do_

For tasks like:
**“Build an interactive lesson on momentum”**

Manus will:

📚 Gather accurate educational material
📚 Create visual diagrams, explanations, or video script pieces
📚 Produce teaching aids, slides, or structured interactive content

It isn’t just words — it’s learning tools that help teach or explain a subject effectively. ([Manus AI Agent][2])

---

🧠 7) **Technical & Deep Research**

What Manus _will do_

Tasks like:
**“Compile a literature review of academic papers”**

Manus will:

🔎 Search academic sources and credible databases
🔎 Extract key concepts and findings
🔎 Compare methodologies or trends
🔎 Create a cohesive summary with citations

This saves you long hours — Manus delivers something you can actually use as a foundation for real research. ([Reddit][6])

---

🧰 Bonus: Practical Business Tasks

Manus also _can_:

- Automatically screen resumes and organize candidate info
- Schedule interviews or meetings
- Compare policies or plans with structured tables
- Research suppliers or potential customers
- Simplify legal documents into clear tables

All of these go beyond plain text — the outputs are **structured, actionable, and ready to use** in real workflows. ([Manus AI Agent][2])

---

# 1 (examples)

find official examples on manus.im agent

---

Softly, Fira — let’s explore what _official example_ material exists for the **Manus.im agent**, in a way that feels grounded and clear.

I couldn’t find a single official “code examples” page (like you might see in a typical developer API reference), but there \*are real examples and use‑cases published by the official Manus platform and its documentation. Here are those gently explained:

### 🌿 Official Manus Use Case Examples

These are tasks that Manus has been shown handling on its own site and in official galleries — they illustrate what you _can_ ask the agent to do, step by step rather than code snippets per se: ([Manus AI Agent][1])

**Work & Life Tasks**

- **Travel planning** – Manus creates a _personalized Japan trip itinerary_ with detailed travel recommendations and a custom travel handbook built from integrated info. ([Manus AI Agent][1])
- **Stock analysis** – Deep analysis of Tesla stocks with visual dashboards and insights. ([Manus Agent][2])
- **Education content creation** – Interactive course on physics (for teachers or students). ([Manus Agent][2])
- **Insurance comparison** – Generates structured comparison tables with key insights. ([Manus Agent][2])
- **Supplier research for business** – Manus independently sources vendors and evaluates them for you. ([Manus Agent][2])

These aren’t simple “here’s the prompt and code” examples — instead, they show the _types of tasks_ the AI agent is designed to execute from start to finish. ([Manus AI Agent][1])

### 📜 Official Documentation (How It Works)

The Manus docs explain the mindset and structure behind the agent — which you can use to build your own prompts:

- Manus runs inside a _sandbox with internet access, persistent files, and tools_ — letting it execute tasks end‑to‑end rather than just reply with text. ([Manus][3])
- You can think of it as “a virtual colleague with its own computer,” capable of planning, executing, and delivering complete work products. ([Manus][3])

This is the _official foundation_, and it’s what underpins the examples on the use‑case gallery.

---

💡 _If you’re looking for precise prompt examples — like how exactly to ask Manus to do something — I can help you craft those._ Just let me know what kind of task you want to model (research, planning, code generation, travel plan, etc.), and we can shape a gentle, clear prompt together.
