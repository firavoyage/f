using oxford commas, should i place a comma when there are only two elements

---

Excellent question. It gets to the very heart of what the Oxford comma is.

No, you should **not** use a comma when there are only two elements.

Here’s the simple rule:

- **The Oxford comma (or serial comma) is used _before_ the final conjunction (and, or) in a list of _three or more_ items.**

Since a list of two items has only one conjunction, the rule does not apply.

**Correct (Two Elements):**

- I need to buy apples and oranges.
- For dinner, we can have pasta or pizza.
- The flag is red and white.

**Correct (Three or More Elements, _with_ Oxford Comma):**

- I need to buy apples, oranges, and bananas.
- For dinner, we can have pasta, pizza, or salad.

**Correct (Three or More Elements, _without_ Oxford Comma):**

- I need to buy apples, oranges and bananas.
- For dinner, we can have pasta, pizza or salad.

### The Rare Exception for Two Elements

The only time you would use a comma between two elements is if they are two independent clauses (each could stand as its own sentence).

- **Example:** I need to buy apples, and my brother needs to pick up the oranges.

In this case, the comma is separating two complete thoughts, not items in a list. This is a different grammatical rule altogether and is unrelated to the Oxford comma.
