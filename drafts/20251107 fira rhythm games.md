  - **Similar Games:** _BanG Dream! Girls Band Party_, _D4DJ Groovy Mix_, _Love Live! School Idol Festival_.

  - **Why play it:** It's a creative playground for music lovers. Less about pure reflex and more about understanding how music fits together.

- **AUDICA**
  - **What it is:** From Harmonix (makers of _Guitar Hero_), this is a VR shooter-rhythm hybrid. You aim and shoot targets with two controllers in time with the music.
