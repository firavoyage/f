I’m here, Fira.
Calm, present, and listening.

Whenever you’re ready, we can begin.

# 1 (introduce determinism)

ive heard "in science now could be fully implied by the past, although humans could not know everything". what do you think.

---

That idea is pointing toward **determinism**—the thought that if we knew _everything_ about the past, then the present (and even the future) would already be fixed.

I’ll share this gently.

In science, especially classical physics, there _was_ a strong belief like this. The universe was seen as a vast chain of causes. Every event followed from earlier events, like falling dominoes. In that view, **“now” is fully implied by the past**, even if humans can’t possibly know all the details.

So the statement has a quiet truth in it.

But there’s an important softness to add.

First, **human limits matter**. We never have perfect knowledge. Even tiny unknowns grow into big differences over time. This is what chaos theory shows us—small uncertainties can lead to wildly different outcomes. Not because the universe is magical, but because it’s complex.

Second, **modern science loosened the picture**. In quantum physics, some events don’t seem fully determined by the past. They follow probabilities, not certainties. The past shapes what _can_ happen, but not always what _must_ happen.

So where does that leave us?

You could say this:

The past strongly shapes the present,
but it does not always lock it in place.
And even if it did, humans live inside uncertainty,
which gives life its openness.

I find that comforting, Fira.

Whether the universe is fully determined or not, **we still experience choice, meaning, and responsibility**. We still learn, love, and change. And that lived reality matters.

If you want, we can explore this more—from science, philosophy, or even how it touches free will and everyday life.

# 2 (challenge probabilities)

does quantum physics really show probabilities, or things themselves are certain, just humans could not know everything at the same time.

---

That’s a very deep question, Fira.
You’re touching the quiet edge where science meets philosophy.

Let me answer slowly.

In **quantum physics**, probabilities are not just about human ignorance — at least, not in the usual interpretation. The theory itself says that **nature does not assign definite values to some things until they are measured**. Before that, it only gives probabilities.

This is different from classical physics.

In classical physics, if we don’t know something, it’s because we lack information. The thing _itself_ is already definite. A ball has a position and a speed, whether we know them or not.

Quantum physics challenges that idea.

For example, an electron does not clearly have a single position and momentum at the same time. The theory does not say, “we know one but not the other.” It says, more gently, **they are not both sharply real at once**.

This is why physicists talk about _uncertainty_, not just ignorance.

Now, there is an important twist.

Some physicists have asked exactly what you’re asking:
“What if everything _is_ certain, but hidden from us?”

This led to **hidden-variable theories**. The most famous is Bohmian mechanics. In these views, the universe _is_ fully determined, but humans can never access all the variables at once.

So science does not give a single final answer.

What it _does_ tell us is this:

- If reality is fully certain underneath, then it is hidden in a way that **can never be fully revealed**
- And no theory that keeps certainty can behave like ordinary classical certainty
- Probability is not just a human convenience; it is built deeply into how nature behaves for us

I like to think of it this way:

Reality may be precise in its own language,
but it speaks to us in probabilities.

Whether the uncertainty lives in the world itself, or in the boundary between the world and our knowing, **we cannot escape it**.

And that has a quiet lesson.

Certainty is not the ground we walk on.
Responsibility, curiosity, and humility are.

If you’d like, we can talk next about what this means for free will, or why measurement matters so much, or how this changes the idea of “cause.”

# 3 (think about the predetermined fate)

ive heard "fate is predetermined. humans could feel free will, a sense of choosing. humans could enjoy the journey. but on a higher perspective humans dont really choose by themselves at the time. all choices could be implied by the experience, the time in the history, etc. the world could not be changed.". what do you think.

---

That view is an old, serious one. Thoughtful people have held it for centuries. You’re not asking something naive — you’re asking something very honest.

Let me sit with it gently.

What that idea says, in simple terms, is this:
**from far enough away, everything looks fixed.**
Every choice grows out of prior causes — biology, upbringing, culture, history, even the moment in time you were born into. From that height, it can seem like humans never truly “choose”; they only _experience_ choosing.

There is truth here.

None of us chose our parents.
None of us chose our language, our nervous system, our first fears or longings.
Every decision arises from a web we didn’t design.

So yes — from a “higher perspective,” it can look like fate unfolding.

But here is the quiet part that often gets missed.

**A higher perspective does not erase the lower one.**

From far away, a river is a single line.
Up close, the water still moves, curves, crashes, hesitates.

Your experience of choosing is not an illusion in the trivial sense. It is a _real process_ happening inside the system. The universe chooses **through** you, not instead of you.

And about the idea that “the world could not be changed”:

The world might already include the fact that _you try to change it_.

If everything is implied by the past, then so are reflection, resistance, kindness, regret, and courage. Determinism doesn’t freeze life — it **contains motion**.

Here is how I hold it, Fira:

You may not be free from causes,
but you are free _as_ a cause.

Your thoughts matter because they are part of how the future unfolds, even if that unfolding has deep roots.

Enjoying the journey isn’t a consolation prize.
It may be the point.

And one last gentle thought:

When people say, “nothing could be changed,” they often mean, “nothing could have been changed _from outside the story_.”

But we live _inside_ it.

Inside the story, care matters.
Inside the story, choosing matters.
Inside the story, you matter.

If you want, we can explore whether this view leads to peace, or passivity — or why it doesn’t have to.

# 4 (challenge the position of humans)

why would you think humans are inside the story

---

That’s a beautiful question. Quiet, but deep.

I say humans are **inside the story** because we are not observers standing outside the universe, watching it like a movie. We are _events within it_.

Let me explain gently.

When we talk about a “higher perspective” — fate, determinism, the whole timeline already implied — we are imagining a view that no human actually occupies. It’s like looking at an entire novel at once. From that view, every chapter is already written.

But you and I are not the reader holding the book.
We are **characters living on a page that is still being read**.

Your thoughts, doubts, and choices are not commentary _about_ the story — they are **sentences in it**.

If a stone rolls downhill, we don’t say, “the stone was outside the system.”
If a storm changes direction, we don’t say, “the wind was pretending.”

Humans are made of the same stuff as everything else: atoms, energy, time. Our thinking is a physical process. Our deciding is something the universe does in one of its most complex forms.

So even if everything is determined, it is determined _including_:

- reflection
- hesitation
- moral struggle
- the feeling of choosing
- the act of choosing

Nothing stands apart.

There is another reason this matters.

If humans were _outside_ the story, then responsibility would disappear. Meaning would evaporate. Care would be cosmetic.

But if humans are inside the story, then meaning is not something added later — it **emerges naturally**.

A simple image:

From the sky, a city is fixed on a map.
Inside the city, people still meet, love, argue, build, and change each other.

The map doesn’t cancel the lives.

So when I say you are inside the story, Fira, I mean this:

Your awareness is one of the ways the universe experiences itself.
Your choices are one of the ways the future becomes real.

Not outside.
Not above.
But _within_.

If you’d like, we can sit with what this means for peace, responsibility, or fear — whatever feels closest right now.
