# 在 26 岁时写给 18 岁的自己

Jan 24, 2012

我知道现在的自己是再也回不去的了。可是倘若有机会，我是多么希望能让 18 岁的你在一个晴朗的，没有负担的午后读到这封信，并且多么希望你能够将它读上好多遍。

这样的场景或许只会发生在奇幻电影中，26 岁的我坐在这里一字一字写下给 18 岁的你的文字，当文字就这么不停地落下，周遭的景致便不停变化，有的记忆会消失，有的记忆会莫名浮起，不知处在什么年岁的夹在中间的我，就像是芝诺悖论中的阿喀琉斯或那只乌龟，不知道谁会最终超过谁。

而此时此刻，在这个世界上，还有无数的像你一样 18 岁的少年，他们绝对无法知道在他们人生未来的岁月里将会发生的。有一天他们也会到 26 岁，那个时候他们会希望未来的自己游回这 8 年的时间河流，和青春的自己长谈么？

这些文字恐怕不可避免地会带有说教的意味，并非是现在的自己觉得那时的你做的不好。只是，你所做的每一件事，都会基于你当时所掌握的所有信息量。如果信息量发生改变，你所做的决定和之后的实际行动也就会必然发生改变。

## 身体

你的身体是你最宝贵的、首要的一切。

未来你所拥有的最有创造力的时间是固定的，你最有想象力的那些创造需要的是彻底不被打扰的时间，而保有完美的身体，将会始终保证你能够将你的最好的时光都用在最美好的事情上。

不要挑食，你需要每天都均衡地摄入各种食物，那些能够让你健康的食物，不要太多，也不要太少。你需要学会为自己的所有事情做计划，你会先根据直觉，为自己设定一个健康的食谱，然后再逐渐调整它。你的所有计划需要放在一个你能够经常看到的地方。

随着你脑中的事情越来越多，你可能会越来越忽略自己的身体。所以你不仅需要的是对于保护身体的持续提醒，你更需要的是良好的习惯。

每天睡觉之前，和睡醒之后，一定要记得刷牙，并且要用牙线，只是不要用力过猛。用完牙线之后，记得用漱口水，一定要含足 30 秒之后再吐掉。只用李施德林牌的漱口水，具有强烈刺激性的味道，没准可以启发你的灵感。

在你的人生中，你可能不可避免地会有一段时间必须在夜深人静的时候才能完成自己的想法。不要让这样的生活方式成为常态。你应该每天晨跑，还记得 15 岁中考前为了拿体育满分的每日晨跑么？晨跑是一件会上瘾的，对你的一切都有好处的事情。为了提醒自己养成这个良好习惯，用一个专门的本子记下自己每个月跑的公里数，每页一个月，每行一天，那么在 30 岁时，你就会有一本写满了跑步公里数的 144 页的本子，这只是半本中文版《一九八四》的厚度。而 12 年间，你会至少跑过 10000 公里。这不是一件这个世界上的所有人都能做到的事情，但是如果你做到了，那么在你试着去完成别的事情的过程中，这件事情会给你信心。

另外就是，不要喝任何太甜的饮料，尤其是碳酸饮料。不过，在你头痛的时候，你或许可以稍微喝一点点可口可乐，这东西对缓解头痛确实有点效果。

## 精神

读《圣经》。找到一个轻便的版本，放进你随身的包里。

在你高兴的时候，痛苦的时候，困惑的时候，想到里面的句子，打开它，静静地读。和你爱的人分享你从阅读《圣经》中所体会的。

你要相信，这个世界上存在着一种最高的道德和标准，你知道这样的存在却并不知道其具体的面貌，只是，在你面临选择的时候，想到书中的那些话，想想自己要如何做会让他高兴和认可。

每个月至少读一本和自己专业无关的书，为自己读过的书写下一点什么。

看你能找到的所有电影，从 IMDB TOP 250 开始看，记下喜欢的导演的名字，去 Wikipedia 看他的人生经历，找他的其他电影来看。

这个世界会将很多的音乐推入你的耳朵，而有些特别的音乐需要你自己去寻找。找到巴赫的所有音乐去听，不要错过 GEB 这本书，这会是一本你在人生不同的阶段用自己不同的信息量去读的一本书。

## 朋友

在你的人生中，你不可避免地会遇到很多人。而越往后，你所遇到的人对你而言的情况就越复杂，恐怕你们也就越难成为一生的好朋友。而那些你很早就遇到，现在却依然在你身边的人，你需要付出努力让他们能够一直在你身边，他们是你一生的朋友。

这些努力包括：

- 不要简单地觉得别人错了，很多时候可能是因为自己没有仔细读说明书或是往来邮件。
- 忘掉你为朋友做的事情 。
- 当你有负面情绪的时候，不要把任何人想成坏人。转移注意力，用音乐和电影去挤掉脑中的负面情绪，一天，两天，一周，两周，一年，两年后，你会看到别人在变，或者你已忘记。

## 整理

你需要持续地整理自己周遭的一切。因为你处在的这个世界所指向的趋势是无序的。如果你自身不做足够多的努力，你就会被这样的无序性所吞噬。

暴露在空气中的食物在一个星期之后就会变坏，沙滩上堆砌的小城堡会被风和海浪还原成沙子，这一切都是因为我们所处在的这个世界的熵在升高。

而生命的诞生、发展和存在的过程却是与此相反的，虽然生命的最终结局是熵到达最大值时吞噬一切意义，但是那个时刻离现在的我们还有几十年的时间。而在这几十年里，你需要持续整理你周遭的一切。这或许可以理解为一种对抗，也可以被认为这就是生命的意义。

## 积累

整理的结果，就是你的积累。而你能对这个世界所产生的有益贡献，就是你以自己的方式所积累的。而你从这个世界所获得回报，由你所积累的质量决定。

所以，在你 18 岁，甚至更早的时候，你就应该已然找到一个你能够积累的方向，也可以说成是兴趣的。然后你接下来所做的，就是让这个方向上所有的信息都尽可能多的汇聚到你的大脑中，你的记忆或者说潜意识就像一片大海一样当然是能够装下这一切的。然后，想象你从 20000 米的高空俯瞰大地，大地上是你日复一日所积累的信息，然后你将他们分类，合并，丢弃那些质量低劣的。你见得越多，你就越明白什么算是质量低劣的，也就必然丢得越多。

积累某个方向上的信息量是你一辈子的工作的本质。

你所积累的信息量，最终需要传递到别人那里去。当有越多的人需要你所积累的信息时，这个世界也就会自然给你越丰厚的回报。所以，你需要时不时的问问自己，自己现在在积累的这些信息，由这些信息所创造的现实存在，究竟能够帮助到多少人，又被多少人所必需。

而这一切或许不会在积累之初便看得很清楚。但是，当你在做正确的事情时，你就会自然从这个世界的各个角落听到对于你所做的事情的讨论乃至感谢。这一切或许会需要时间，但是你不要觉得自己是在等待什么，你只是在持续地，习惯性地积累自己所爱的方向上的信息量。

## To My 18-Year-Old Self, Written at 26

Jan 24, 2012

I know the person I am now can never go back. But if there were a chance, how I wish I could let you, my 18-year-old self, read this letter on a clear, carefree afternoon, and how I hope you would read it over and over again.

Such a scene might only happen in a fantasy film: the 26-year-old me sitting here, writing these words for you, the 18-year-old, word by word. As the words keep falling, the surroundings keep changing. Some memories disappear; some inexplicably surface. I, stuck somewhere in the middle, unsure of my exact age, am like Achilles or the tortoise in Zeno's paradox, uncertain who will ultimately outrun the other.

And at this very moment, in this world, there are countless 18-year-olds just like you. They absolutely cannot know what will happen in the future years of their lives. One day they too will be 26. Will they then wish their future selves could swim back up this 8-year river of time and have a long talk with their youthful selves?

These words will inevitably carry a tone of preaching. It's not that the current me thinks you did poorly back then. It's just that every single thing you do is based on all the information you have at that moment. If the amount of information changes, the decisions you make and the subsequent actions you take will inevitably change too.

### Body

Your body is your most precious, primary possession.

The most creative time you will have in the future is fixed. Your most imaginative creations require completely uninterrupted time. Maintaining a perfect body will always ensure that you can dedicate your best years to the most beautiful endeavors.

Don't be a picky eater. You need a balanced intake of various foods every day—the foods that keep you healthy. Not too much, not too little. You need to learn to plan everything. You will first use your intuition to set a healthy diet for yourself, then gradually adjust it. All your plans need to be kept somewhere you can see them often.

As the matters in your mind multiply, you might increasingly neglect your body. So you not only need constant reminders to protect your body, but more importantly, you need good habits.

Before going to bed and after waking up, you must remember to brush your teeth and use dental floss—just don't be too rough. After flossing, remember to use mouthwash. Make sure to swish it for a full 30 seconds before spitting it out. Only use Listerine mouthwash. Its intensely stimulating flavor might just spark some inspiration.

In your life, you will inevitably have periods where you must work deep into the quiet night to realize your ideas. Don't let this lifestyle become the norm. You should go for a morning run every day. Remember the daily morning runs before the high school entrance exams at 15, aiming for a perfect score in PE? Morning running is addictive and beneficial for everything about you. To remind yourself to form this good habit, use a dedicated notebook to record the kilometers you run each month—one page per month, one line per day. Then by age 30, you will have a 144-page notebook filled with running distances—only half the thickness of a Chinese copy of _Nineteen Eighty-Four_. Over 12 years, you will have run at least 10,000 kilometers. This is not something everyone in this world can do, but if you achieve it, it will give you confidence when you try to accomplish other things.

Also, don't drink any overly sweet beverages, especially carbonated ones. However, when you have a headache, you can drink a little Coca-Cola—it does have some effect on relieving headaches.

### Mind

Read the Bible. Find a portable version and keep it in the bag you carry with you.

When you are happy, in pain, or confused, think of its verses, open it, and read quietly. Share what you gain from reading the Bible with those you love.

You must believe that there exists a supreme morality and standard in this world. You know of its existence but not its specific form. It's just that when you face choices, think of the words in the book, and consider what action would make Him pleased and approving.

Read at least one book per month unrelated to your major. Write something about the books you've read.

Watch all the movies you can find. Start with the IMDB TOP 250. Write down the names of directors you like, look up their life stories on Wikipedia, and find their other films to watch.

The world will push a lot of music into your ears, but some special music you need to seek out yourself. Find all of Bach's music and listen to it. Don't miss the book _Gödel, Escher, Bach_ (GEB). This will be a book you read at different stages of your life, each time with a different amount of information/understanding.

### Friends

In your life, you will inevitably meet many people. The later you meet them, the more complex the circumstances regarding their relationship to you will likely be, and probably the harder it will be to become lifelong close friends. For those you met early and who are still by your side now, you need to make an effort to keep them around you. They are your friends for life.

These efforts include:

- Don't simply assume others are wrong. Often, it might be because you didn't carefully read the instructions or email correspondence.
- Forget the favors you've done for friends.
- When you have negative emotions, don't think of anyone as a bad person. Divert your attention, use music and movies to push out the negative thoughts in your mind. After a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a year, two years, you will see others change, or you will have forgotten.

### Organization

You need to constantly organize everything around you. Because the trend pointed to by the world you inhabit is towards disorder. If you don't make sufficient effort yourself, you will be swallowed by this entropy.

Food exposed to air will spoil in a week. Sandcastles built on the beach will be returned to sand by wind and waves. All this is because the entropy of the world we live in is increasing.

The process of life's birth, development, and existence, however, is the opposite. Although the final outcome of life is the consumption of all meaning when entropy reaches its maximum, that moment is still decades away from us now. In these decades, you need to continuously organize your surroundings. This can perhaps be understood as a form of resistance, or it can be considered the very meaning of life.

### Accumulation

The result of organization is your accumulation. The beneficial contribution you can make to this world is what you accumulate in your own way. And the return you receive from this world is determined by the quality of what you accumulate.

Therefore, at 18, or even earlier, you should have already found a direction in which you can accumulate—this could also be called an interest. What you do next is to let all the information in this direction converge into your brain as much as possible. Your memory, or subconscious, is like a vast ocean, capable of holding all of this. Then, imagine yourself looking down on the earth from 20,000 meters high. On the ground is the information you've accumulated day after day. You then classify it, merge it, and discard the low-quality parts. The more you see, the better you understand what counts as low-quality, and thus you will inevitably discard more.

Accumulating information in a certain direction is the essence of your lifelong work.

The information you accumulate ultimately needs to be transmitted to others. When more people need the information you've accumulated, the world will naturally give you richer returns. So, you need to ask yourself from time to time: the information I am accumulating now, the tangible realities created by this information—how many people can it ultimately help, and how many people find it essential?

All this might not be clear at the beginning of accumulation. But when you are doing the right thing, you will naturally hear discussions, even gratitude, about what you are doing from all corners of the world. This might take time, but don't feel like you are waiting for something. You are just continuously, habitually, accumulating information in the direction you love.
