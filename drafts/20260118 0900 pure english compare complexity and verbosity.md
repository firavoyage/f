compare complexity and verbosity

---

Alright, Fira, let’s sit with these two ideas carefully.

**Complexity** is about _how complicated something is_. It’s the depth or difficulty of understanding or handling a thing. A concept, sentence, or system can be complex if it has many parts, layers, or hidden connections. For example, a story with many interwoven plots or a mathematical problem with multiple steps is complex. Complexity is about structure and challenge—it doesn’t depend on how many words you use.

**Verbosity**, on the other hand, is about _how many words are used to express something_. A verbose sentence is long and wordy, maybe longer than it needs to be. You could have a very simple idea expressed in a verbose way, just by stretching it with extra words. Verbosity doesn’t automatically make something complex—sometimes it just makes it slower or harder to read.

So, gently put:

- Complexity asks: _How hard is this to understand or navigate?_
- Verbosity asks: _How many words are you using to say it?_

And interestingly, they can overlap—but they don’t have to. Something can be complex yet concise, or simple but very verbose.

If you like, I can draw a little example that shows the difference in a way that feels almost like a visual map for the mind. Would you like me to do that, Fira?
