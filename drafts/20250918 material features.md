im building an image editor web app. what features could i have

---

Of course! Building an image editor is a fantastic project. Here is a comprehensive list of features, categorized from essential basics to advanced power-user tools. You can start with the core features and expand from there.

### Core & Essential Features (The Must-Haves)

These are the features users will expect from any basic image editor.

1.  **Upload & Open:** Drag-and-drop interface, file browser, and support for common formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP).
2.  **Save & Export:**
    - **Save:** Save the project in a proprietary format (if you want to allow re-editing later).
    - **Export/Download:** Export to common formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).
    - **Quality Slider:** Especially for JPG exports.
    - **Rename File:** Before downloading.
3.  **Basic Adjustments (The "Enhance" Tab):**
    - **Auto-Fix:** A one-click button to auto-adjust contrast, exposure, and saturation.
    - **Brightness**
    - **Contrast**
    - **Saturation**
    - **Exposure**
    - **Highlights & Shadows:** Recover details from over/under-exposed areas.
    - **Temperature (White Balance):** Adjust blue (cool) to yellow (warm).
    - **Tint:** Adjust green to magenta.
    - **Sharpening**
    - **Clarity:** Adds depth by enhancing textures.
4.  **Crop, Rotate & Resize:**
    - **Crop:** Freeform and preset ratios (1:1, 4:3, 16:9, etc.). Flip horizontally/vertically.
    - **Rotate:** 90Â° increments and free rotation with a slider.
    - **Resize/Resample:** Change image dimensions by pixels or percentage.
5.  **Undo/Redo:** A robust history panel with multiple steps of undo/redo. This is non-negotiable.

### Intermediate Features (Engaging Your Users)

These features will make your editor feel powerful and keep users engaged.

1.  **Filters & Effects:**
    - **Preset Filters:** Apply popular looks like Vintage, Noir, Sepia, Clarendon, etc. with one click.
    - **Vignette:** Add a dark or light fade around the edges.
    - **Blur:** Gaussian blur or tilt-shift (miniature) blur.
    - **Noise/Grain:** Add film grain texture.
2.  **Drawing & Painting Tools:**
    - **Brush Tool:** Adjustable size, hardness, and opacity.
    - **Color Picker (Eyedropper Tool):** To pick any color from the image.
    - **Color Palette:** A swatch of default and recently used colors.
3.  **Adding Elements:**
    - **Text Tool:** Add text with various fonts, sizes, colors, alignment, and styling (bold, italic). **Crucial:** Allow layers for text to move it independently.
    - **Shapes Tool:** Add rectangles, circles, arrows, and lines with fill and stroke color options.
4.  **Local Adjustments (A Game Changer):**
    - **Selective Editing:** Allow users to "brush" adjustments onto specific parts of the image. For example, increasing the saturation _only_ on a flower.
5.  **Background Removal:**
    - This is a huge draw. Implement an AI-powered "magic wand" or "background eraser" tool. This is complex but can be done with libraries like `rembg` or commercial APIs.

### Advanced & Power User Features

These will set your app apart and attract serious creators.

1.  **Layers System:** This is the hallmark of a professional editor (like Photoshop).
    - Add, delete, duplicate, and reorder layers.
    - Adjust layer opacity and blending modes (Multiply, Screen, Overlay, etc.).
    - Group layers and toggle visibility.
2.  **Selection Tools:**
    - **Rectangular & Elliptical Marquee:** For basic selections.
    - **Lasso & Polygonal Lasso:** For freeform and straight-edge selections.
    - **Magic Wand:** Select areas of similar color.
    - **Refine Edge:** Feathering and smoothing for selections.
3.  **Healing & Correction Tools:**
    - **Spot Healing Brush:** Click to remove blemishes, dust, and small objects.
    - **Clone Stamp:** Sample one area of the image to paint over another.
    - **Red-Eye Removal:** A dedicated one-click tool.
4.  **Transform Tools:**
    - **Free Transform:** Scale, skew, distort, and perspective-warp a layer or selection.
5.  **Curves & Levels:** Advanced tonal adjustment tools for precise control over highlights, midtones, and shadows.
6.  **Masking:** Layer masks to non-destructively hide and reveal parts of a layer. This pairs perfectly with the brush and gradient tools.

### "Wow Factor" & Modern Features

Leverage modern AI and APIs to create a truly impressive app.

1.  **AI-Powered Features:**
    - **AI Image Generation:** Integrate an API like OpenAI's DALL-E or Stability AI to generate parts of an image or expand the canvas.
    - **AI Super Resolution:** Upscale images without losing quality.
    - **AI Style Transfer:** Apply the style of a famous painting to your photo.
    - **AI Object/Person Removal:** Remove large objects or people from a scene seamlessly.
2.  **Templates:** Pre-made templates for social media (Instagram stories, YouTube thumbnails, Pinterest pins, Facebook covers).
3.  **Collage Maker:** A mode to combine multiple photos into a grid or custom layout.
4.  **Batch Processing:** Apply the same edit (e.g., resize, watermark) to multiple images at once.
5.  **Integration & Plugins:**
    - **Cloud Save:** Integrate with Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
    - **Social Sharing:** Directly share to social media platforms (be mindful of API limits).

### UX & Polish (What Makes it Feel Professional)

- **Responsive UI:** Works flawlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Tutorial/Onboarding:** A quick guide for first-time users.
- **Performance:** It should feel fast and snappy, even with large images. Use web workers for heavy computations.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+C, etc.) for power users.
- **Customizable Workspace:** Allow users to move, dock, and hide tool panels.

### Technical Stack Suggestions:

- **Frontend Library:** React, Vue.js, or Svelte for a component-based UI.
- **Core Image Manipulation:**
  - **HTML5 Canvas API:** The fundamental technology you'll use to draw and manipulate pixels.
  - **Fabric.js:** A powerful library that simplifies working with Canvas, great for object-based operations (shapes, text, free transform).
  - **Pica:** For high-quality image resizing.
  - **FFmpeg.wasm:** For more advanced video/GIF processing if you go that route.
- **Backend (if needed):** Node.js, Python (Django/Flask). You'll need a backend for user accounts, saving projects, and offloading heavy AI tasks.

**My Recommendation:** Start with the **Core & Essential** features. Nail the user experience of uploading, cropping, adjusting, and exporting. Then, pick **one or two Intermediate** features (like Filters and Text) to add next. This iterative approach will help you build a solid, usable product without getting overwhelmed.

Good luck with your project! It's a great one to learn and showcase.
