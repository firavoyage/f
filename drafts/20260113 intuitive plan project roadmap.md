How is a Project Roadmap created in big software companies. Show me a mindmap as a nested list.

---

Alright, Fira. Let’s walk through this slowly and clearly.

In big software companies, a **project roadmap** is not created all at once.
It grows step by step, shaped by strategy, people, and reality.

Here is a **mindmap as a nested list**, showing how it usually comes together.

---

### **Project Roadmap Creation (Big Software Companies)**

- **1. Company Strategy & Vision**

  - Long-term business goals
  - Market positioning
  - Customer problems to solve
  - Competitive landscape
  - Success metrics (growth, retention, revenue, trust)

- **2. Product Strategy**

  - Product vision and principles
  - Target users and personas
  - Core value proposition
  - Product boundaries (what it will _not_ do)
  - Alignment with company strategy

- **3. Discovery & Research**

  - User research

    - Interviews
    - Surveys
    - Usage data

  - Market research
  - Technical feasibility checks
  - Risk identification
  - Assumption mapping

- **4. High-Level Initiatives (Themes)**

  - Major problem areas to address
  - Strategic themes (not features yet)
  - Examples:

    - Improve onboarding
    - Increase performance
    - Expand integrations

- **5. Stakeholder Alignment**

  - Engineering leaders
  - Product managers
  - Design leads
  - Sales and marketing
  - Operations / support
  - Leadership review and buy-in

- **6. Breakdown into Epics**

  - Large bodies of work per initiative
  - Cross-team dependencies identified
  - Rough effort estimation
  - Technical constraints surfaced

- **7. Prioritization**

  - Impact vs effort analysis
  - Business value scoring
  - Risk reduction
  - Regulatory or contractual needs
  - Capacity and team availability

- **8. Timeline Shaping (Now / Next / Later)**

  - Short-term (committed)
  - Mid-term (planned)
  - Long-term (directional)
  - Buffers for uncertainty
  - Explicit assumptions noted

- **9. Roadmap Visualization**

  - Timeline or theme-based view
  - Clear goals per period
  - Minimal feature detail
  - Focus on outcomes, not tasks
  - Different versions for different audiences

- **10. Validation & Communication**

  - Leadership sign-off
  - Team walkthroughs
  - Feedback loops
  - Adjustments based on reality
  - Shared understanding across the company

- **11. Continuous Review & Adaptation**

  - Regular roadmap reviews
  - Learning from delivery
  - Market or customer changes
  - Strategy updates
  - Roadmap evolves, not “locks”

---

### A gentle truth

In big companies, a roadmap is **not a promise**.
It is a **conversation made visible**.

It balances:

- Direction over certainty
- Learning over control
- Alignment over perfection

If you’d like, Fira, I can also:

- Show a **simple example roadmap**
- Compare **startup vs big-company roadmaps**
- Explain **who owns which part**
- Or help you **create one step-by-step**

Just tell me where you want clarity next.

# 2

How are things arranged

---

Let’s slow this down, Fira, and look at the shape of it.

In big software companies, **things are arranged from the widest view to the smallest action**.
Like a river flowing from the mountains to the sea.

Here is the natural order.

---

### **How Things Are Arranged (Top to Bottom)**

- **1. Vision**

  - Why the company exists
  - What future it is trying to create
  - Rarely changes

- **2. Strategy**

  - How the vision will be achieved
  - Where to focus energy
  - What to prioritize _and_ what to avoid
  - Changes slowly

- **3. Product Direction**

  - Which customer problems matter most
  - Which products or platforms carry the strategy
  - Sets boundaries and intent

- **4. Themes / Initiatives**

  - Big problem areas
  - Outcome-focused, not feature-focused
  - Example: “Reduce time-to-value for new users”

- **5. Epics**

  - Large chunks of work that support a theme
  - Often cross teams
  - Still about outcomes, not tasks

- **6. Features**

  - Specific solutions users will see
  - Designed, debated, adjusted
  - Can change without breaking the roadmap

- **7. Stories / Tasks**

  - Small, actionable work items
  - Owned by teams and individuals
  - Highly flexible

---

### **Another way to feel it**

- **Leadership** lives mostly at levels 1–4
- **Product managers** live at levels 3–6
- **Design & engineering teams** live at levels 5–7

Everyone overlaps a little.
No one owns everything.

---

### A quiet insight

The higher you go, the **less detail** and **more meaning** you hold.
The lower you go, the **more detail** and **less certainty** you accept.

Problems happen when:

- Leaders jump too low
- Teams are forced too high
- Or details are mistaken for direction

If you want, Fira, we can next:

- Walk through a **real example**
- Map this to **one project**
- Or explore **where confusion usually begins**

Just let me know.

How is an app created in big companies. Show me a mindmap about the Project Roadmap in the Planning and Design phase as a nested list.

---

That’s a good place to look, Fira.
Big companies move carefully at the beginning, because early clarity saves a lot of pain later.

I’ll walk you through this gently, as a **mindmap written as a nested list**, focused only on the **Planning & Design phase** of an app project.

Think of this as the quiet thinking time before anything is built.

How is a Project Roadmap created in big software companies. Show me a mindmap about deciding the order of things as a nested list.

---

Alright, Fira. Let’s slow this down and look at it the way big software companies usually do it — calmly, step by step, without rushing to solutions too early.

A **project roadmap** is not a task list.
It’s a shared understanding of _what comes first, what comes later, and why_.

Here is a **mind-map style nested list** that shows how the _order of things_ is decided.

---

### Project Roadmap Creation (Big Software Companies)

- **1. Start with the “Why”**

  - Company vision
  - Business goals (growth, retention, revenue, trust)
  - Problem being solved
  - Who it matters to (users, customers, internal teams)

- **2. Understand the Reality**

  - Current product state
  - Technical constraints
  - Team capacity and skills
  - Dependencies on other teams
  - Legal, security, compliance needs

- **3. Define Outcomes (not features)**

  - Desired user behavior change
  - Success metrics (KPIs)
  - What “better” looks like
  - What _doesn’t_ need to be perfect yet

- **4. Collect Possible Initiatives**

  - New features
  - Improvements
  - Technical debt cleanup
  - Infrastructure upgrades
  - Experiments and research
  - Risk-reduction work

- **5. Evaluate Each Initiative**

  - User impact

    - How many users?
    - How painful is the problem?

  - Business impact

    - Revenue, cost, risk

  - Effort

    - Time
    - Complexity
    - Unknowns

  - Confidence

    - How sure are we this will work?

- **6. Decide Order (Prioritization Logic)**

  - Must-have vs nice-to-have
  - High impact / low effort first
  - Foundational work before visible features
  - Risky unknowns earlier (to learn fast)
  - Dependencies (A must exist before B)

- **7. Shape the Roadmap Timeline**

  - Now (next 1–3 months)

    - Clear goals
    - High confidence

  - Next (3–6 months)

    - Direction is clear
    - Details are flexible

  - Later (6–12 months)

    - Intent only
    - Open to change

- **8. Align and Adjust**

  - Share with stakeholders
  - Listen to feedback
  - Adjust expectations
  - Re-order if reality changes

- **9. Treat the Roadmap as a Living Thing**

  - Revisited regularly
  - Updated with learning
  - Changed without guilt
  - Used to guide, not control

---

### A quiet truth big companies learn:

> The roadmap is not about being right.
> It’s about being **aligned, adaptable, and honest**.

If you’d like, Fira, I can:

- Simplify this into a **one-page mental model**
- Show how engineers vs product managers think about order
- Walk through a **real example** (like building a new feature)

Just tell me where you want clarity next.
