close tabs

**dont deep dive into a lot of tools.** leverage thinking (what's/whether it's pragmatic.)

**trust my intuition more.**

curiosity... good. but dont over do it. (e.g. divide literature)

**do some meta things. these help.**

opencode skill. test. learn by doing. (tell llms my ideas. dont be afraid of overfitting.)

**finish things: close, organize, prepare/think... importance over urgency.**

Search online for information. After using scrcpy and closing it, my Android browser becomes unusable. Weird selection behavior, no effect pressings buttons. Input focus issue. How to solve. See voices.

Using Gboard, intentionally adding a space after commas all the time, is that common. Why doesn't Gboard auto enable this.

What are people saying about Gboard Chinese support. What are their suggestions.

I must be clearer and more rigorous in case mediocrity of llms happens. To humility: maybe one more layer could work. For now, just go fast, learn by doing, test, and retry. 

Use specific method as long as it works, get general with abstraction when needed.

Reset input state with adb after closing scrcpy. Always manual close. Reset with phone terminal

Make tools elegant: make every existing useful tools elegant in my way. 

Make knowledge pure: organize the world of information and make it universally accessible.
