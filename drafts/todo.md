i dont need infinite power. dont dive into tooling. sometimes working is enough.

leverage thinking: practical wisdom, whether pragmatic or not

trust my intuition more.

curiosity... good. but dont over do it. (e.g. divide literature)

do some meta things. these help.

opencode skill. test. learn by doing. (tell llms my ideas. dont be afraid of overfitting.)

finish things: close, organize, think, prepare... importance over urgency.

humility

claude code / opencode impression (vids).

learn from opencode. read over the docs. 

clarify the idea. simplify.

design the architecture (e.g. the folder shape).
