be simple. leverage thinking.

i dont need infinite power. dont dive into tooling/methodology.

an intuitive mind is sacred.

curiosity... good. but dont over do it.

learn by doing. 

finish things: close, organize, think, prepare... importance over urgency.

create the design system: read the chat, guidelines.

minimal style.

think what a chat app should have. only trust my intuition.

(believe: llms suck at design & archi. dont waste time. i mean open ended tasks with clear quality measurement. not math/algorithms, not literature.)

- think what a chat app should have.
- write down.
- give llms the context (components, design). generate everything.
- generate layout.
- iterate.
- (test, docs)

complete.

follow the spec.

- parse (done)
- act
- tools: sh. read. write. edit.
- plan. agent.md... files. (todo, memory, ...) custom fs like manus?
- docker? let's try it.
