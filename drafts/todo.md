**dont deep dive into a lot of tools.** leverage thinking (what's/whether it's pragmatic.)

**trust my intuition more.**

curiosity... good. but dont over do it. (e.g. divide literature)

**do some meta things. these help.**

opencode skill. test. learn by doing. (tell llms my ideas. dont be afraid of overfitting.)

**finish things: close, organize, prepare/think... importance over urgency.**

today:

- intention: ~~background, enter, search. that's enough.~~ fix. (rushing... but it could work.)
- humility: clarify, make some real progress: write some code (trust intuition).
- humility: market research (leverage meta thinking!)
- anything else (e.g. twitter)
