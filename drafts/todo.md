**dont deep dive into a lot of tools.** leverage thinking (what's/whether it's pragmatic.)

**trust my intuition more.**

curiosity... good. but dont over do it. (e.g. divide literature)

**do some meta things. these help.**

opencode skill. test. learn by doing. (tell llms my ideas. dont be afraid of overfitting.)

**finish things: close, organize, prepare/think... importance over urgency.**

create a web extension called intention. support both chromium and firefox. prioritize chromium.

it overrides new tab page. it accesses omnibox and all current tabs.



write code that is clear, simple, and intention-revealing; modular and cohesive; reliable and maintainable, following SOLID principles.

show me the full code.

---

create a full screen workflow. move the omnibox onto the new tab, as well as current tabs. 

dont rush.

---

intention:

- wallpaper: shader (think how to find ...)
- settings.json
- enter: wise
- text: search
- url: go

minimal. just roboto. top half.

no border. no cursor. clear selection.

always focus.

---

intention -> (humility?!) -> journal.

ask some good questions. 

---

journal readme

---

organize all.

---

today:

- intention: background, enter, search. that's enough.
- humility: clarify, make some real progress: write some code (trust intuition).
- humility: market research (leverage meta thinking!)
- anything else (e.g. twitter)
