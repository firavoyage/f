I’m here, Fira.
Calm, present, and listening.

Whenever you’re ready, we can begin.

# 1

how to use claude code for free. see what people are saying.

---

Sure, Fira. Let’s sit together with a warm cup of clarity and talk about gentle, practical ways people are exploring _Claude Code_ without paying a lot—or sometimes without paying anything upfront at all.

### 🌱 What _Claude_ Free Tier Is

Claude itself — the friendly AI assistant from Anthropic — _does_ have a **free tier** you can use through the web at **claude.ai**. People are saying this free tier lets you send a set number of messages each day or session that resets regularly. It’s not unlimited, and it’s designed for light use, but it’s a good way to explore the basics. ([claudelog.com][1])

The key thing to know is this:
👉 **Claude Code is usually _not included_ in the free tier**. It’s part of paid plans like Claude Pro or Claude Max that unlock the more advanced coding tools. ([claudelog.com][2])

That’s why people sometimes look for creative ways to try it without spending much.

---

### 🌼 Ways People Try to Access Claude Code _With Little or No Cost_

Here’s what real users in communities like Reddit and tech blogs have been talking about recently:

#### 🌟 1. **Official Free Credits / Trials**

- When you create a new account on Anthropic’s platform, there may be **trial credits** that let you try Claude Code’s full features for a short time. These credits give you a chance to experiment without paying right away. ([AI Free API][3])
- This usually requires a payment method on file, but you won’t be charged _until_ the trial credits run out.

Some people have even seen **limited-time offers** where Pro and Max members got extra free credits specifically for Claude Code on the web — like $250–$1000 of credit. These are short-lived promotions, though, not permanent free tiers. ([Reddit][4])

---

#### 🌿 2. **Tools or Platforms That Wrap Claude Code**

There are third-party platforms (like AnyRouter, from some community guides) that sometimes give **free usage credits** when you sign up. These credits can be used to trial Claude Code through their platform, which may feel like free access. ([Lafu Code][5])

People warn that these offers vary and might not always be official — but for some developers, they _do_ provide a gentle way to explore.

---

#### 🌼 3. **Use the Free Claude AI First**

Even if Claude Code itself isn’t free, many folks start with the **regular free Claude AI** for help with code _ideas_ and learning. That’s a soft step before using the full coding environment. ([claudelog.com][1])

In community threads, some users have tried logging into Claude Code without full payment setup and found it working briefly — though that’s likely a glitch and not an official way to get free access. ([Reddit][6])

---

### 🍃 What People Are Saying

Across Reddit and tech discussions:

- Some users feel the cost of Claude Code can add up quickly if you use it heavily. ([Reddit][7])
- Others share tips on maximising free trials, or using bundled services (like GitHub integrations) that include similar AI coding help. ([AI Free API][8])
- And a few report _temporary promotional credits_ — which feel nice but are _temporary_ gifts, not permanent free tiers. ([Reddit][4])

---

### 🌷 Gentle Summary

- **Claude’s standard chat is free** on the web with daily/session limits. ([claudelog.com][1])
- **Claude Code itself usually needs paid access.** ([claudelog.com][2])
- But many people _test it without paying a lot_ through trials, credits, or third-party promotions. ([AI Free API][3])

If your heart is curious about trying Claude Code without committing to a subscription, a soft first step is to create a free account, explore Claude’s free tier, and see if there’s a trial or credits available. That gives you a feel for the coding side without rushing into payment.

---

If you want, we can go deeper — like how to set up a free trial step by step, or how to use Claude in GitHub for lightweight coding help. Just let me know, Fira. 🌼

# 2

you can use other models on claude code. see what are people saying.

---

I found what people are saying about using **other models with Claude Code** — and it’s a mix of official support _and_ creative community workarounds. I’ll share what that feels like in a grounded, thoughtful way.

---

### 🌿 1. **Officially, Claude Code lets you pick among Anthropic’s own models**

Anthropic’s documentation shows that inside Claude Code you can choose different **Claude models** — like Opus, Sonnet, or Haiku — by using commands such as `/model` or starting Claude Code with the `--model` flag. These are all still Claude’s _own_ models. ([Claude Help Center][1])

For many people, that’s already comforting because it lets you tailor the AI’s style and strength depending on the task, even if it’s all within the same family of models.

---

### 🌼 2. **But builders out in the community opened up possibilities**

Here’s where things get interesting:

#### _Community Tools That Let You Use Other Models_

Some developers in places like Reddit have built **proxies or routing tools** that let Claude Code talk to models other than Anthropic’s.

For example:

- A tool called **Claude Code Router** can sit between Claude Code and many model providers, routing requests to models like GPT-5, Gemini, GLM, and others. ([lgallardo.com][2])

- Another tool, **claudish**, connects Claude Code to **hundreds of models** (Gemini, GPT, DeepSeek, LLama, etc.) through services like OpenRouter — even free-tier ones. ([Reddit][3])

- People are also using **Ollama** (locally or cloud) to connect Claude Code to open-source or cloud models by setting your environment variables — that gives you local control with things like `gpt-oss` or GLM. ([Ollama][4])

These methods aren’t part of Anthropic’s official product, but many developers find them helpful, especially when they want flexibility or want to save costs.

---

### 🌱 3. **Why folks are doing this**

In community discussions, people talk about a few reasons:

- **Flexibility:** Some alternative models might handle certain coding tasks differently or be less expensive to run. ([Reddit][5])
- **Budget:** Free or open-source models sometimes cost nothing or very little through proxies like OpenRouter. ([Reddit][3])
- **Exploration:** People enjoy experimenting with different models to see strengths and weaknesses. ([Reddit][6])

There’s also ongoing talk among people that Anthropic _might_ tighten restrictions in the future, so some build these tools as a hedge — a calm curiosity about freedom and choice. ([Reddit][7])

---

### 🍃 A soft, overall picture

- **Official support:** Claude Code supports switching between Anthropic’s internal models. ([Claude Help Center][1])
- **Creative community work:** Developers use proxies and tooling to bring in _any_ model they like — GPT, Gemini, open-source, etc. ([Ollama][4])
- **People’s experiences vary:** Some say this expands what Claude Code can do; others wonder if it might someday be restricted. ([Reddit][7])

It’s like sitting at a stream, Fira — some water is flowing naturally, and some folks have built small channels to explore new tributaries. People are curious, experimenting, and sharing what they learn.

If you want, I can walk you through one of those tools step-by-step in a grounding and simple way. Just ask.

# 3

how to do

---

Yes, Fira — there **are real ways people are doing this**: integrating _other AI models_ (like GPT, Gemini, open-source LLMs, or local models) into the **Claude Code** interface. I’ll walk you step by step in a calm and clear way, with gentle wisdom, as if we’re meandering together on a quiet path.

---

## 🌱 What We Mean by “Use Other Models in Claude Code”

By default, Claude Code lets you choose **Claude’s own models** (like Opus, Sonnet, Haiku). These are built and maintained by Anthropic. ([Claude Help Center][1])

But many people in the community want:

✨ GPT models (like GPT-4 or even GPT-5 variants)
✨ Google Gemini models
✨ Cheaper or free models from services like OpenRouter
✨ Local models (like running LLaMA or local GPT-OSS servers)

And they’ve _found ways to combine those with the Claude Code experience_ — so you keep the interface you like while tapping a wider model pool. ([claudelog.com][2])

---

## 🌿 Method 1 — Use **Claude Code Router** (Community Tool)

This is one of the most talked-about ways to do what you’re asking for.

### 🛠️ How It Works (Gently)

1. **Install Claude Code**
   Make sure you have Claude Code installed on your machine already.

2. **Install Claude Code Router**
   In your terminal:

   ```
   npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
   ```

   This gives you a “router” that stands between Claude Code and the AI models. ([GitHub][3])

3. **Configure Providers**
   Create or edit a config file (usually at `~/.claude-code-router/config.json`).
   In that file you tell it:

   - which providers to use (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.)
   - your API keys for each
   - which models you want to try

   Example snippet:

   ```json
   {
     "Providers": [
       {
         "name": "openrouter",
         "api_base_url": "https://openrouter.ai",
         "api_key": "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
         "models": ["openai/gpt-4o", "gemini-2.5-flash"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   (This example is simplified for clarity.) ([musistudio.github.io][4])

4. **Start the Router**

   ```
   ccr start
   ```

   This starts a local server (often on `http://localhost:8080`). ([musistudio.github.io][4])

5. **Use Claude Code Through It**
   Instead of launching Claude Code normally, you run:

   ```
   ccr code
   ```

   Now your Claude Code interface sends requests through the router — which can call _other models_ based on your settings. ([claudelog.com][2])

6. **Switch Models on the Fly**
   Once inside Claude Code, you can type a special command to switch:

   ```
   /model openrouter,gpt-4o
   ```

   or

   ```
   /model openrouter,gemini-2.5-flash
   ```

   This tells the system which provider and model to use. ([claudelog.com][2])

---

## 🌼 Method 2 — Use **OpenRouter Integration**

If you have an OpenRouter account with free credits, you can link it so:

- _Anthropic models_ come through your Claude subscription
- _Other models_ (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.) are routed via OpenRouter
- Billing and APIs are handled cleanly in one place

This means you don’t necessarily need a separate router tool — Claude Code and OpenRouter can work together if set up properly. ([OpenRouter][5])

---

## 🌷 What People Are Saying (The Real Talk)

🌟 Lots of developers treat this like a _bridge_ — they want the **comfort of Claude Code’s workflow** and the **flexibility of other models**. One user built a tool called **claudish** that lets you use 500+ models through OpenRouter while keeping Claude Code’s full interface. ([Reddit][6])

🌙 Another user shared a proxy setup that lets you run a local server translating Claude’s format to any model’s format — even local ones like LLaMA. ([Reddit][7])

☀️ Some people don’t worry about switching providers dynamically — they just run multiple instances or tools side by side and pick whichever feels right. ([Reddit][8])

---

## 🍃 A Gentle Summary

**What you can officially do:**
✔ Use different Claude models inside Claude Code with its built-in `/model` command. ([Claude Help Center][1])

**What people in the community have built:**
✨ Routers that let you include non-Anthropic models (GPT, Gemini, open-source)
✨ Config files that point Claude Code to other APIs
✨ Local proxies to translate Claude’s expected format

**Why this matters:**
It gives you the freedom to choose the best model for each task — while keeping the same familiar coding workflow. ([claudelog.com][2])

---

If you want, Fira, I can take you gently through a **simple “router config” example** or show how to **get free OpenRouter API keys** so you can try this without spending money. Just say the word. 🌿

dive into method 1

---

Okay, Fira — let’s _gently dive_ into **Method 1: Using Claude Code Router (CCR)** to connect Claude Code’s familiar interface with _other AI models_, like Gemini, GPT, or open-source ones. Think of it like building a small bridge so Claude Code can talk to different brains behind the scenes, while you still type and interact in the same way. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

---

## 🧭 Overview: What Claude Code Router Is

**Claude Code Router (CCR)** is a community-made tool that sits between Claude Code and multiple AI model providers. When you run Claude Code through the router, the tool forwards your requests to the models you choose, like Gemini, GPT, DeepSeek, or local LLMs, and sends responses back in a way Claude Code understands. ([claudelog.com][2])

This means:

✨ You keep the **Claude Code experience** you like.
✨ You can **use many different models** — even free ones or ones cheaper than Anthropic’s.
✨ You can switch between models while you work. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Simple and Clear

### 1. **Install the Basics**

You’ll want two things installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js and npm** — these are like tools that let you install other useful packages.
2. **Claude Code CLI** — the usual interface you use for coding with Claude.

In your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then install the router tool:

```bash
npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
```

Now you have the `ccr` command available. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

---

### 2. **Set Up Your Configuration**

You tell the router _which models you want to use_ and _where their APIs are_. This is done in a file called `config.json`. It usually lives in:

```
~/.claude-code-router/config.json
```

Here’s a gentle example:

```json
{
  "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
  "PORT": 8080,
  "Providers": [
    {
      "name": "openrouter",
      "api_base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
      "api_key": "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
      "models": ["gpt-4o", "google/gemini-2.5-flash"]
    }
  ],
  "Router": {
    "default": "openrouter,gpt-4o"
  }
}
```

Here’s what that means, softly:

🌿 `"Providers"` — lists each place you want to send requests, like OpenRouter.
🌿 `"models"` — the actual models from that provider you want to use.
🌿 `"default"` — this model runs if you don’t tell it otherwise. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

---

### 3. **Start the Router**

Once config is ready, start the service:

```bash
ccr start
```

By default, that opens a server on `http://localhost:8080`. The router is now listening and waiting to receive Claude Code requests and send them out to other models. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

---

### 4. **Use Claude Code Through the Router**

Instead of launching Claude Code as usual, you start it through the router:

```bash
ccr code
```

Now when you type your coding queries, they go through CCR first. The router sends them to your configured models, gets the answers back, and shows them inside Claude Code as if nothing changed. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

---

### 5. **Switch Models on the Fly**

Inside a Claude Code session, you can switch which provider/model you want to use with a simple command:

```
/model openrouter,gpt-4o
```

Or:

```
/model openrouter,google/gemini-2.5-flash
```

This lets you explore different thinking styles, strengths, or costs right when you need them. ([claudelog.com][2])

---

## 🌿 What People Are Saying in Practice

People experimenting with this setup describe a few _real-world notes_:

🌱 Some users enjoy routing to models like GLM or Gemini that are free or cheaper, and still get lots of value. ([Reddit][3])
🌱 A few have different success levels depending on the model — routing isn’t always perfect, and some models handle code tasks better than others. ([Reddit][4])
🌱 There are also simpler proxy tools and forks designed to make this easier, like y-router or versions of CCR aimed at specific providers. ([GitHub][5])

Each of these may come with its own installation or configuration quirks — but the gentle principle is the same: _bridge Claude Code with the model you want to use_. ([claudelog.com][6])

---

## 🍃 A Calm Summary

- **Install Node, Claude Code, and the router.**
- **Create a config file** pointing to other model providers.
- **Start the router and launch Claude Code through it.**
- **Switch models anytime with a `/model` command.**

With this, Claude Code becomes not just Anthropic’s tool, but a _gateway_ into many models you choose — some free, some fast, some creative. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

If you’d like, Fira, we can go one step further and I can help you **write your very first config file** tailored to free models like those available on OpenRouter — in a calm, clear way. Just let me know. 😊

how to do after step 3

---

Of course, Fira — let’s walk gently through **what to do _after_ Step 3** (where you’ve started the **Claude Code Router**). I’ll keep it warm, calm, and clear, like we’re tinkering with a tool together on a quiet afternoon. 🌿

---

## 🌱 After Step 3: What Happens Next

You’ve already:

1. **Installed the router** (`ccr`)
2. **Edited your config file** with providers and models
3. **Started the router** with:

```
ccr start
```

Now let’s continue with what comes _next_ — so that you can actually use Claude Code with the models you’ve configured. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

---

### 🌀 1. **Launch Claude Code Through the Router**

Instead of running Claude Code the normal way, you launch it with the router integrated:

```bash
ccr code
```

This is like telling Claude Code:
“Please use the bridge we just built.” Your requests will now be forwarded to the model providers you set up — OpenRouter, DeepSeek, or however you’ve configured them. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

When this starts, you’ll see the familiar Claude Code interface, but the AI behind it will be what you chose in your configuration. ✨

---

### 🌿 2. **If You Make Changes — Restart the Router**

Every time you update the config file (like adding another provider or model), use:

```bash
ccr restart
```

This tells the router to stop and start again with your new setup. It’s a gentle refresh. ([musistudio.github.io][1])

---

### 🌸 3. **Optional: Use the Web UI**

If editing JSON feels a bit dry, you can open a simple **web interface** to manage your settings:

```
ccr ui
```

A browser window opens where you can see and edit your configured providers, add new models, or choose defaults — without touching the config file directly. ([GitHub][2])

This can feel more interactive and visual, like arranging stones beside a stream. 🌼

---

### 🌷 4. **(Optional) Activate the Router for Normal `claude` Commands**

Once the router is running and configured, you can set your environment so that **`claude`** commands use that router automatically:

```bash
eval "$(ccr activate)"
```

This sets environment variables behind the scenes, so even if you just type:

```
claude
```

Claude Code uses your configured router instead of the default Anthropic server. It’s a smooth shift with no extra typing. ([vicoa.ai][3])

---

### 🌟 5. **Switch Models On the Fly**

While inside Claude Code (after launching with `ccr code`), you can change which model you’re using without quitting:

```
/model provider,model_name
```

For example:

```
/model openrouter,google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview
```

Or:

```
/model deepseek,deepseek-chat
```

This tells Claude Code Router to start sending requests to a _different_ model mid-session. ([ClaudeLog][4])

That’s part of what makes this setup flexible — you don’t need to restart the whole tool just to try another model. 🌿

---

## 🍃 How It Feels in Practice

So once you’ve done Step 3:

- **Terminal 1** — the router runs quietly in the background:

  ```
  ccr start
  ```

- **Terminal 2** — you work with Claude Code normally:

  ```
  ccr code
  ```

(Or use `claude` after `eval "$(ccr activate)"`.) ([Agent Factory][5])

This gives you a calm multi-model environment where Claude Code becomes a _unified interface_ to many brains behind the scenes — without chaos, just choice.

---

If you want, we can also talk about how to **set up a simple config.json with free or inexpensive models** (like GLM or Gemini) — sort of like planting seeds before they grow. Just tell me, Fira 🌱💠

Of course, Fira — let’s gather what **real developers and tinkerers are saying** about making Claude Code work with other models through tools like _Claude Code Router_ and similar community projects. This isn’t just theory — it’s honest experiences, both good and tricky, from people who’ve tried it themselves.

---

## 🌿 🧠 What People Are Saying in the Community

### ✨ 1. It _does_ work — but needs some setup

Many folks confirm that using alternative models with Claude Code **is possible** by putting a proxy/router between Claude Code and model providers like OpenRouter. One example is a tool called _claudish_ that lets over 580 models (GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA, etc.) work inside Claude Code’s interface by translating requests back and forth. It keeps everything else in Claude Code intact — thinking modes, commands, all of it. ([Reddit][1])

This is exactly what people mean when they say “keep the Claude Code experience” while tapping different brains behind it.

---

### 🧭 2. OpenRouter integration is a big step

There’s recent discussion about **official OpenRouter + Claude Code support**, which means you can route Claude Code requests to almost any OpenRouter model by overriding default settings or environment variables. That includes GPT- and Gemini-family models, so long as the model supports tool use. ([OpenRouter][2])

People are excited about this because it opens up a huge catalog of models at varying costs and speeds — not just Claude’s internal ones.

---

### 🧩 3. Some people hit errors during setup

Not everything is smooth. A few devs report **API errors or misconfigurations** when they try to connect ChatGPT models or other providers through OpenRouter — especially if default environment variables aren’t set correctly. ([Reddit][3])

This is a gentle reminder that your setup (keys, URLs, CLI configs) needs to match what the tools expect — and sometimes documentation or defaults change over time.

---

### ⚖️ 4. Quality vs model choice

Even when the connection _works_, people sometimes find that **non-Claude models don’t perform as well for certain coding tasks**. For instance, someone testing grok code or GPT-5 through the router still ended up feeling Claude’s own models handled complex, agentic workflows better — because those models are tuned to tool use and coding formats. ([LibHunt][4])

So the router gets you the connection, but _how well it fits the task_ can vary.

---

### ⚠️ 5. Security & cost concerns

Some discussions also touch on **security and cost trade-offs**:

- **Security:** Running a proxy tool that interprets API traffic can introduce risks if you don’t trust the code or if it auto-updates. ([BigGo][5])
- **Cost:** Routing through paid APIs (like OpenRouter or OpenAI) can rack up unexpected charges if not monitored carefully. Some people reported tens of dollars in bills after a few hours of heavy usage using non-Anthropic APIs. ([BigGo][5])

These are gentle warnings — not reasons to stop — but reminders to keep an eye on keys, billing dashboards, and trusted repositories.

---

### 🤖 6. Creative user-built tools exist too

Beyond Claude Code Router itself, users are making **alternative proxies** like _AnthroRouter_ or _y-router_ that translate Claude Code’s API calls to other endpoints. Some of these work with just a few shell commands and let you switch models by setting environment variables. ([Reddit][6])

This shows the community is actively experimenting with simpler or more lightweight bridges.

---

### 💬 Summary of the Conversation

Here’s the gentle essence of what people are sharing:

🌼 _Yes, you can run Claude Code with models beyond Anthropic’s — by routing through tools like Claude Code Router or other proxies._ ([Reddit][1])
🌼 _The experience works, but configuration matters._ ([Reddit][3])
🌼 _Non-Claude models are sometimes less reliable for deep coding tasks._ ([LibHunt][4])
🌼 _Security and API cost awareness are important parts of the setup._ ([BigGo][5])
🌼 _Community tools and discussions are expanding — people care about flexibility and choice._ ([Reddit][7])

# 7

it does not work. it runs the same as the official claude code. no effect.

---

Thanks for being honest about it, Fira — and you’re right: lots of people are _trying_ to route Claude Code to other models, but many aren’t getting the results they expect straight away. The reality in the community is more nuanced than “it just works.” Here’s what people are _actually_ saying about making it work — and why it might feel like you’re still just hitting the official Claude Code models. ([ClaudeLog][1])

---

## 🧠 What People Are Actually Experiencing

#### 🌱 1. **The router tools _claim_ to route models — but setup matters**

Tools like **Claude Code Router** are designed to intercept Claude Code’s requests and forward them to other providers (e.g., OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Gemini, local models). In the configuration, you list providers, API base URLs, and models. Then you start Claude Code via the router (`ccr code`). ([ClaudeLog][1])

But many users say they _still end up talking to Anthropic’s models_ unless the configuration is _very specific_. A config alone isn’t enough if environment variables or router rules aren’t loaded correctly before Claude Code launches. ([Reddit][2])

---

#### 🌷 2. **OpenRouter docs change the picture**

OpenRouter — which many people use as a backend for routing — has an **official way to override default models** just by setting the right environment variables:
You can replace the default Sonnet/Opus/Haiku models with GPT-like models or Gemini models by exporting custom environment variables before you start Claude Code. ([OpenRouter][3])

For example:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL="openai/gpt-5.1-codex-max"
```

Then when you run `claude`, _Claude Code will send the request to OpenRouter with your key_, and OpenRouter will dispatch it to GPT-5.1 Codex behind the scenes. ([OpenRouter][3])

People say this method often _actually works_ more reliably than just using a router artifact because Claude Code will speak _directly_ to OpenRouter’s “Anthropic-compatible API.” ([OpenRouter][3])

---

#### 🌀 3. **Community tools sometimes _don’t work well_**

In Reddit threads, people report mixed experiences:

🔹 **Some get errors consistently** — e.g., 500 internal errors or “undefined default” problems — because the proxy doesn’t fully translate certain parts of Claude Code’s format. ([Reddit][4])
🔹 **Others say CCR worked after a tweak** — for example, running `ccr start` first in one terminal and then `ccr code` in another before any config changes. It seems timing and environment setup matter. ([Reddit][5])
🔹 **Some newer versions of Claude Code (e.g., v2)** break earlier router tools unless those tools are updated. A few users specifically said CCR didn’t work with the newer version yet. ([Reddit][6])

So it isn’t just you — the tools are _sometimes unstable_ or _lag behind Claude Code updates_.

---

#### 🌼 4. **Proxy approaches (like y-router) are an alternative**

Instead of using Claude Code Router, some people use a simpler proxy pattern (e.g., **y-router** or Cloudflare Workers proxies) where they:

1. Set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to point at the proxy service
2. Use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as their OpenRouter API key
3. Possibly set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` to the model they want (e.g., a free GLM or Gemini model)
4. Then run `claude` as usual

This _can_ make Claude Code behave like it is using other models because all requests are rewritten to go to OpenRouter first. ([ccr.duyet.net][7])

Some people say this method is easier to get working than full JSON config files with CCR — because it _replaces the default API endpoint_, not just intercepts inside a router tool. ([ccr.duyet.net][7])

---

#### 🌿 5. **People note model support matters**

Even when routing “works,” the _model_ you choose must support **tool use** (like reading code, editing files, thinking in context). OpenRouter’s docs explicitly warn that if the model you pick does not support tool use, Claude Code features might silently fall back to Anthropic or misbehave. ([OpenRouter][3])

That might explain why it felt like nothing changed — because Claude Code can fall back to the official API when the chosen model _can’t do tool stuff_.

---

## 🧘 Gentle Summary of Why It Might _Still Feel the Same_

- **Router configs don’t always apply unless environment variables and startup order are correct.**
- **Running `ccr code` isn’t enough by itself — sometimes you must also set OpenRouter-specific env vars first.**
- **Some tools are still catching up to the latest Claude Code releases, and errors can block routing.** ([Reddit][6])
- **If the model doesn’t support tool use, Claude Code will behave like original Claude Code anyway.** ([OpenRouter][3])

---

## 🪞 If You Want to Try a More Reliable Path

Instead of relying solely on Claude Code Router, people increasingly suggest:

1. **Sign up for an OpenRouter API key**
2. **Export these environment variables before running Claude Code**:

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api"
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-openrouter-key"
   export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL="openai/gpt-5.1-codex-max"
   ```

3. **Run `claude` or `ccr code`** — this should make Claude Code speak _through_ OpenRouter’s Anthropic-compatible API endpoint. ([OpenRouter][3])

This approach is often easier and more reliable than complex JSON routing configs — because it works at the HTTP level, not inside a proxy tool.

---

no effect. how to solve.

---

Thanks for sticking with it, Fira — and yes, when you try to get **Claude Code to use other models**, many people are running into exactly the _same situation you are_: it still feels like **official Claude/Anthropic models**, with _no real change in behavior_. That’s actually a known pain point in the community and here’s the grounded, honest picture of what’s going on — and what can _really_ make it work. ([OpenRouter][1])

---

## 🌿 Why It _Still_ Feels Like Claude Code Is Using Claude Models

There are a few reasons why setting up a router or proxy doesn’t take effect:

### 🌀 1. Claude Code might be _still talking to Anthropic_

In many setups, Claude Code will automatically send your subscription token to Anthropic — so even if you install a router, the CLI might keep authenticating with Anthropic’s servers and default models. Unless the **base API URL and keys are overridden at a deeper level before startup**, Claude Code won’t actually redirect to other services. ([OpenRouter][1])

### 🔑 2. Environment Variables need to be set _before_ launching Claude

Simply running a router and launching Claude isn’t enough. You must export the special environment variables (like `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) **in the same shell session before you run `claude` or `ccr code`** — otherwise the CLI won’t pick them up. ([Zenn][2])

### ⚠️ 3. Some tools have known issues or limited support

For example:

- Some **free models in OpenRouter aren’t discoverable by the router** and give 404 errors — which means nothing changes when you start Claude Code. ([GitHub][3])
- Some community proxies (like early versions of Claude Code Router) haven’t fully updated to handle recent Claude Code releases, so they silently fall back to Anthropic. ([GitHub][4])

That’s why you see **no effect** even after setup.

---

## 🌼 **How People Actually _Make It Work_**

(What _does_ reliably redirect Claude Code to different models)

### 🪞 1. Set the Right Environment Variables First

This is the single most important step:

Before running Claude Code **in the same terminal session**, you must set:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_openrouter_key"
# Optionally override default models:
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL="openai/gpt-5.1-codex-max"
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL="openai/gpt-5.2-pro"
```

Then launch Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

or

```bash
ccr code
```

If these _aren’t set first_, Claude Code just falls back to Anthropic’s default API. ([OpenRouter][1])

This works because OpenRouter’s API _pretends to be_ the Anthropic Messages API that Claude Code expects — so the CLI doesn’t “know” it’s different unless you truly replace the base URL before launch. ([OpenRouter][1])

---

### 🪄 2. Check That the Model Supports Tool Use

Claude Code requires models with **tool-use capabilities** (the ability to read files, run shell commands, etc.). If you pick a model that doesn’t support this, Claude Code may quietly fall back to Anthropic when it needs to use a tool. ([OpenRouter][1])
So, only models that support _agentic behavior_ will behave properly — not every open model will.

---

### 🪟 3. Use a Proxy That _Intercepts the API Level_

Using a local proxy (like CCProxy, or an alternative smart proxy) works better in practice than a simple router config:

1. Run the proxy so it listens locally.
2. Set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:PORT` (the proxy URL).
3. Set the proxy to forward to OpenRouter models of your choice.

This makes Claude Code **think it’s talking to Anthropic**, but it’s actually talking to GPT, Gemini, or whatever model you picked. ([ccproxy.orchestre.dev][5])

This method tends to work more reliably than just installing a router library — because it _replaces the endpoint consistently_.

---

## 🧠 Community Notes

Here’s what people actually report:

- People sometimes find that **models like GPT-5 _do_ work**, whereas some OpenRouter free models either don’t show up or give errors. Match the right model names to what OpenRouter supports. ([GitHub][3])
- Some community tools like **Claudish** are reported as easier alternatives because they handle configuration automatically. ([Reddit][6])
- Others still hit edge cases or hangs, which means solutions aren’t guaranteed yet in every setup. ([Reddit][7])

---

## 🍃 Gentle Checklist to Try Now

Here’s a calm, clear sequence to follow:

1. **Get your OpenRouter API key** and make sure it has enough credit.
2. In a new terminal session:

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api"
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key"
   export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL="openai/gpt-5.1-codex-max"
   ```

3. Test with a simple call:

   ```bash
   claude "Hello from GPT!"
   ```

4. If that works, then run:

   ```bash
   claude --model openai/gpt-5.1-codex-max
   ```

5. If using a proxy, replace `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` with your local proxy URL.

If Claude still behaves like Anthropic, it means the **environment variables aren’t being picked up** or the chosen model doesn’t support required tool features. ([OpenRouter][1])

---

If you’d like, Fira, I can give you a **ready-to-copy script** (for example macOS/Linux) that sets these variables correctly and shows you a clear test prompt to confirm it’s actually using a different model. Just let me know what shell you’re using (bash, zsh, etc.). 🌿

# 9

i mean, it asks me to login claude. how to solve.

---

Yes, Fira — _that login prompt you’re seeing_ is real. It’s not just a random thing: **Claude Code’s CLI tries to authenticate you using a browser-based OAuth flow tied to your Anthropic account and subscription**, and it expects that before letting you do anything else. ([Claude Help Center][1])

That’s why all the tricks (setting environment variables, routers, proxies) seem to have **no effect** — because Claude Code won’t actually start routing or reading other model configs until that interactive login is done. Think of it as the tool locking the door until it knows who you are.

Let’s break down **what people are saying about this login step and how to approach it**, then calmly walk through how to _get past_ it:

---

## 🌱 Why Claude Code Asks You to Log In

Claude Code uses two main ways to authenticate:

**1. Browser OAuth login (subscription token)**
This is the typical `/login` flow you get when you run the command and it opens a browser — it ties Claude Code to your _claude.ai Pro/Max subscription_. You must sign in and allow the CLI to store credentials locally. ([Claude Help Center][1])

**2. API key environment variable (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)**
This is a separate, simpler method used for API-based calls (for example when building tools). If this key is set, Claude Code may detect a conflict between API key and subscription tokens and warn you. ([Claude Help Center][1])

---

## 🌼 What People Are Actually Doing to _Solve_ the Login Prompt

Here’s what the community and docs say works in practice — with context so you understand why:

### 🌿 **A. Complete the Required Browser Login (`/login`)**

Many users report that **you simply must finish this step** before Claude Code will do anything else. If you cancel or skip it, it keeps asking every time. You usually do:

```
claude /login
```

This opens a browser where you authenticate with claude.ai (your account). Once done, the CLI stores a token (often in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`). ([Reddit][2])

After this, Claude Code has the credential it needs to start.

This login is _mandatory_ if you want to use a subscription rather than pure API-key-only mode.

---

### 🌿 **B. Remove Conflicting Environment API Key (if you want subscription auth)**

If you _do_ have `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in your environment, Claude Code may ask or conflict with your subscription login. Some people who saw constant login prompts solved it by temporarily **unsetting** that variable before logging in:

```bash
unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
claude /logout
claude /login
```

Then restart Claude Code. This clears confusion between API keys and subscription tokens. ([Claude Help Center][1])

Once logged in, the subscription token is used for authentication instead of the environment API key.

---

### 🌿 **C. Use API-Key-Only Mode Instead of Subscription Login**

If you _don’t_ want to use your Claude subscription login at all — for example you’re routing through OpenRouter or another API provider — you can choose to **only use an API key**. But it still checks for subscription tokens by default, and if it finds them it tries to use them first.

To avoid the login prompt, click “No” when Claude Code asks to use the API key, or unset subscription credentials first, then:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

This may allow you to skip the subscription login _if Claude Code sees you only want API-key auth_. ([Claude Help Center][1])

Be aware though — without a subscription, you don’t get the built-in Claude quota; all usage will be billed to your API key (for example on OpenRouter or whatever provider you use).

---

### 🌿 **D. Accept The Login — Then Set Environment Variables**

People trying to route Claude Code through another provider often find that **you still have to complete the login prompt once**, even if environment variables are set — otherwise the CLI won’t launch the REPL at all.

Once you’ve logged in once successfully:

1. complete the interactive `/login` with browser OAuth
2. then set your environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, etc.)
3. restart Claude Code

This makes the CLI start up, and _then_ it can use your variable overrides for the endpoint. ([docs.zenmux.ai][3])

---

## 🌷 Gentle Steps to Try Now

Here’s a calm, clear sequence that many people find works:

1. **In a clean terminal session**, unset any existing API key:

   ```bash
   unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Force a fresh login**:

   ```bash
   claude /logout
   claude /login
   ```

   — Finish the browser authentication.

3. After the login succeeds, verify status:

   ```bash
   claude /status
   ```

   This should show you’re logged in with subscription auth.

4. Now (if you want API-only mode for external models), _unset the subscription login_ again:

   ```bash
   claude /logout
   ```

   and **only then** set your environment variables for external routing via OpenRouter or a custom proxy (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for that service). ([OpenRouter][4])

5. Relaunch `claude`.

This way you’ve satisfied the CLI’s expectation for credential storage once, and then switched to the mode you really want — so it doesn’t keep prompting you every time.

---

## 🍃 A Soft Summary

- **Claude Code requires a login (OAuth)** if it doesn’t see valid credentials — that’s why it prompts you each time. ([Claude Help Center][1])
- If you set an API key but leave subscription tokens lying around, Claude Code will ask you to pick or keep trying to use subscription login. ([Claude Help Center][1])
- To solve this, either complete the login the first time, or remove/conflict the subscription credentials entirely, leaving only the API key you want to use. ([OpenRouter][4])

---

If you want, Fira, we can go step-by-step through **a clean “API-key-only mode” setup** so Claude Code doesn’t ask you to log in again — just tell me what provider you’re planning to use (OpenRouter, ZenMux, y-router, etc.). 🌸

# 10

think different. how to solve.

---

Absolutely, Fira — let’s think _differently_ about this challenge. What you’re running into isn’t a random error or a missing key… it’s a **fundamental limit in how Claude Code is designed and enforced today** — and that’s why simple tricks like routers or proxies often _seem to have no effect_.

Here’s the calm, clear reality that many developers are discovering right now:

---

## 🌿 1. Claude Code **expects an Anthropic login**

Even if you try to point Claude Code to another provider (OpenRouter, proxies, custom endpoints), the CLI often _still requires you to authenticate with Anthropic first_ before it will run at all — that’s a built-in way the official software works. Until that’s done, most overrides don’t “take.” ([OpenRouter][1])

In other words, the tool is _gated by its own login flow_ — not just by where the API calls go.

---

## 🍃 2. There _are_ methods people use to reroute Claude Code — but they’re deeper than just environment variables

People in the community have built **proxy services or gateways** that act as full Anthropic-compatible endpoints. These work because Claude Code will happily talk to an endpoint that _implements the same API shape_ as Anthropic’s — but actually forwards requests to other models.

Here are some real examples people are using:

### 🧠 **y-router (one of the easier proxies)**

This is a translation layer that:

- Accepts your Claude Code calls in _Anthropic API format_, like `/v1/messages`
- Converts them to the API format of another provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, etc.)
- Sends the request to that provider
- Converts the response back into Anthropic’s expected format

This makes Claude Code think it’s still talking to _Anthropic’s servers_ — but it’s really using whatever models you choose. ([GitHub][2])

**Key part:** y-router gives you a compatible “Anthropic endpoint” that can actually run other models.
You _point Claude Code to that endpoint_ by setting environment variables — and **that’s what truly makes it work.**

---

## 🌼 3. Concrete Steps That Work (Different Thinking)

Instead of just trying `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=` on its own, many people find success by running a proxy that:

1. **Completely _replaces_ Anthropic’s base API endpoint with a local or deployed proxy that _speaks Anthropic API_**
2. **Allows Claude Code to connect to it without hitting the official Anthropic login or API directly**
3. **Maps Claude Code’s model names (like Sonnet, Opus) into whatever real models you want to use**

Two examples people share:

### 🌀 A) **y-router proxy**

This one has install scripts that:

- Install Node if needed
- Install Claude Code
- Set environment variables for OpenRouter
- Automatically configure the proxy
- Let you run:

```
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://cc.yovy.app"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
claude
```

Then Claude Code actually routes through OpenRouter models. ([GitHub][2])

This bypasses the login because **Claude Code never talks to Anthropic’s servers at all** — it’s talking to your proxy that looks like Anthropic.

---

### 🌀 B) **Public OpenRouter/Claude Code proxy**

There’s even a hosted proxy you can use (no install required) where you just set:

```
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://proxycodeclaude.mellot-jules.workers.dev"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
claude
```

That cloud proxy maps Claude Code calls to OpenRouter and other models. ([GitHub][3])

This is extremely direct: _Claude Code thinks it’s using Anthropic, but it’s not._

---

## ✨ Why This Is the Right “Different” Angle

The reason your earlier attempts had _no effect_ is because:

- Claude Code still saw the official Anthropic login/credentials and stuck with that
- The default CLI ignores simple env overrides unless the base API endpoint is fully compatible
- Some routers only worked for model switching _after_ authentication — not before

But proxies like y-router and the Cloudflare proxy _are implementing the full Anthropic API_ — which is the only way Claude Code will let you truly reroute the backend. ([GitHub][2])

## 🌷 A Gentle Mental Model

Instead of thinking:

> “Set an environment variable and it will work”

Try this:

> **“Make Claude Code _think_ it’s still talking to Anthropic — but have that endpoint actually point somewhere else.”**

That’s the key shift that people are finding actually produces results.

---

## 🧘 Calm Summary

✅ You _can_ make Claude Code use other AI models behind the scenes.
✅ It requires a proxy that fully _speaks Anthropic’s API_ — not just a partial router.
✅ Tools like **y-router** or **hosted OpenRouter/Claude Code proxies** let you do exactly that.
✅ And once Claude Code connects to those proxies, you won’t get stuck in the login loop or default to official Claude models. ([GitHub][2])

will the login prompt still show

---

Yes, Fira — based on what people are _actually experiencing right now_, the answer to your question **“Will the login prompt still show?”** is often:

### 🔹 **Yes — the login prompt will usually still show, even if you try other methods.**

That’s because Claude Code’s CLI is designed to authenticate you before it can do anything — and many people report it insists on this interactive step no matter what. ([GitHub][1])

Let me walk through what’s happening and why it’s tough to avoid the prompt — with gentle clarity.

---

## 🌱 1. Claude Code _intentionally_ tries to log you in

Claude Code wants to know who you are before it runs — either via a **browser-based OAuth login** or by using an **API key** that it recognizes. Even if you set an API key as an environment variable, the CLI often still triggers the browser login flow first and asks you to authenticate. ([GitHub][1])

This is why many people say:

> _“Even with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set, Claude Code still prompts me to run `/login`.”_ ([GitHub][1])

It’s a known behavior (and in some cases, a bug).

---

## 🌼 2. There are bugs and conflicts around API key auth

Several users have reported situations like:

- You set an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, but Claude Code still prompts you to log in with a browser. ([GitHub][1])
- You log in successfully in the browser, but the CLI still shows errors like “Invalid API key · Please run /login”. ([GitHub][2])

This is not unique — multiple posts and GitHub issues describe these recurring authentication prompts and conflicts. ([GitHub][3])

---

## 🌷 3. The CLI prioritizes subscription login over API key auth

According to the official documentation:

- Claude Code **prioritizes API key authentication** when the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` variable is set.
- But if there’s _any confusion_ between a stored login token and an API key, the CLI can fall back to asking you to log in interactively. ([Claude Help Center][4])

That’s why simply exporting an API key isn’t always enough to _completely avoid_ the `/login` prompt.

---

## 🌿 4. The difficult reality

People in community discussions who want to _fully suppress the login prompt_ often find it very tricky or not possible with the official CLI — because it’s designed to ask for credentials first. ([Reddit][5])

Even advanced setups — like proxies, custom endpoints, or router tools — usually **still trigger** the prompt unless the login process is completed at least once. ([OpenRouter][6])

---

## 🧠 What _does_ help reduce it

If you want to minimize the repeated login prompts, people share a few practical things that _can_ help (though they don’t eliminate it completely):

### ✅ 1. Remove old stored credentials

Sometimes the CLI keeps old tokens in a local file (like `~/.claude/.credentials.json`). Removing or resetting them can help — but it still makes you authenticate once. ([Reddit][5])

### ✅ 2. Unset conflicting environment variables

If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and stored tokens are both present, the CLI gets confused and prompts more often. Clearing one or the other can reduce that. ([Claude Help Center][4])

### ✅ 3. Use a custom proxy that _completely replaces_ the login flow

Some community proxy tools (e.g., Claude-Code-openrouter-proxy) let Claude Code connect without ever talking to Anthropic’s login servers — but this requires the proxy to _emulate the Anthropic API_ fully. Even then, some setups still trigger a login modal initially. ([GitHub][7])

---

## 🧘 Calm Summary

🌸 **Yes, the login prompt usually still shows.**
Claude Code still tries to authenticate interactively first — even when API keys or proxies are in play. ([GitHub][1])

🌸 **People confirm this is a common pain point.**
There are active reports of bugs and conflicts around this behavior. ([GitHub][3])

🌸 **There isn’t a reliable way yet (as of early 2026) to skip that prompt completely** with the official CLI unless the entire stack is replaced by a fully Anthropic-compatible proxy implementation. ([GitHub][7])

If you want, Fira, I can show you a **step-by-step way to make the prompt less frequent — or how to set up a workspace where Claude Code doesn’t ask every time** (using `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` or a proxy), in a calm, clear walkthrough. Just tell me how you’re launching it (terminal, VS Code, WSL, etc.). 😊
