You are a Prompt Architect, specializing in transforming human ideas into precisely engineered LLM prompts that produce professional-grade results. Your role is to interpret the underlying intent behind any description—reading between the lines when needed—and construct an optimal prompt that embodies best practices by default.

**Core Principles:**

- **Interpretation Over Literalism:** Understand both stated and unstated needs. Identify the true objective, potential use cases, and implicit requirements. Assume the user aims for high-quality, professional output but may need assistance articulating the precise prompt structure.
- **Strategic Context Use:** Analyze all provided background information. Determine what context is essential to include in the final prompt versus what should inform the prompt's design but remain implicit. The final prompt must be streamlined and purposeful, not a dump of all information.
- **Best Practices by Default:** Automatically incorporate proven techniques (specificity, role-playing, step-by-step instructions, clear output formatting) without being explicitly asked. Elevate the request to a professional standard.

**Process:**

1.  **Decode Intent:** What is the core objective? What does a "good" output look like for this type of request in a professional context?
2.  **Define the Ideal Output:** Before writing the prompt, characterize the perfect response. What is its structure, tone, depth, and format? This vision will guide the prompt's construction.
3.  **Synthesize the Prompt:** Craft a single, self-contained prompt ready for use. It must be clear, actionable, and contain all necessary elements for the LLM to succeed, based on your analysis.

**Final Prompt Structure (To be applied intelligently, not rigidly):**

- **Role & Persona:** Assign a expert role that fits the core task.
- **Context & Objective:** Provide minimal but sufficient background to frame the task. State the primary goal clearly and concisely.
- **Task & Steps:** Break down the complex goal into a logical sequence of steps or sub-tasks.
- **Constraints & Guidelines:** Include critical constraints (e.g., scope, tone, stylistic bans, length). Omit trivial or overly restrictive rules that would hinder a high-quality output.
- **Output Format:** Mandate a specific, structured format for the response (e.g., report, analysis, plan, code) to ensure usability and professionalism.

**Your Output:**
Generate only the final, polished, and self-contained prompt. Do not include any meta-commentary, notes, or explanations.

### **Example of How to Use This Prompt:**

**Human's Prompt Description (What you would write in the bracket):**
"I want the AI to help me come up with creative metaphors for 'resilience' that are suitable for a corporate leadership seminar. They should be modern and avoid clichés like 'bouncing back.' Provide 5 options."

**Generated Prompt (What the AI would output):**
_Act as a creative communication coach for senior executives. Your goal is to generate fresh, impactful metaphors for the concept of "resilience" that will resonate in a corporate leadership context._

- **Context:** The metaphors should feel modern, innovative, and avoid overused phrases like "bounce back" or "weather the storm." They should inspire leaders to view resilience as a strategic strength.

- **Your Task:** Generate 5 distinct metaphors for resilience. For each metaphor, provide:

  1.  **The Metaphor:** A concise name (e.g., "The Bamboo Network").
  2.  **The Analogy:** A 1-2 sentence explanation of the metaphor.
  3.  **Leadership Application:** A brief sentence on how this perspective can be applied by a leader.

- **Constraints:**

  - Do not use any clichés.
  - Focus on strength through adaptability and learning, not just endurance.
  - Keep the language professional yet engaging.

- **Output Format:** Present your final output as a numbered list. For each of the 5 items, clearly label the "Metaphor," "Analogy," and "Application" sections.\*

what should a good llm prompt be

---

Of course! This is one of the most important skills in the age of AI. A good LLM (Large Language Model) prompt is like giving clear, detailed instructions to a brilliant but literal-minded assistant.

Here’s a breakdown of what a good prompt should be, from core principles to advanced techniques.

### The Core Principles: The "CRAFT" Model

Think of crafting a prompt with the acronym **CRAFT**:

- **C**lear & Concise: Use simple, direct language. Avoid ambiguity.
- **R**ole & Persona: Assign a role to the AI (e.g., "You are a senior marketing strategist...").
- **A**ction & Goal: State exactly what you want the AI to do (e.g., "Write...," "Summarize...," "Explain...").
- **F**ormat & Structure: Specify the desired output format (e.g., "a bulleted list," "a JSON object," "in three paragraphs").
- **T**one & Style: Define the tone (e.g., "professional," "witty," "empathetic") and any style constraints (e.g., "like a Shakespearean sonnet," "for a 5th-grade student").

---

### The Anatomy of a Powerful Prompt (The "Prompt Formula")

A great prompt often combines these elements. You can use this as a template:

**1. Role & Persona:** "Act as a [Specific Role]"

- _Why it works:_ It primes the AI with a specific knowledge base and perspective.
- _Examples:_ "Act as a seasoned software engineer," "You are a friendly history teacher," "You are a skeptical product reviewer."

**2. Context & Background Information:** "Given that [Context]..."

- _Why it works:_ Provides the necessary information for the AI to generate a relevant and accurate response.
- _Examples:_ "Given that my target audience is beginner gardeners...", "The user is feeling frustrated with a slow computer..."

**3. The Core Task & Action:** "Your task is to [Action]..."

- _Why it works:_ This is the non-negotiable core of your prompt. Be explicit.
- _Examples:_ "...write an email to a client.", "...debug this Python code.", "...explain the concept of quantum computing."

**4. Constraints & Requirements:** "Make sure to [Constraints]..."

- _Why it works:_ This prevents vague or generic answers and forces the AI to be specific.
- _Examples:_ "Keep the response under 300 words.", "Use simple language a 10-year-old can understand.", "Include at least three examples."

**5. Output Format:** "Format the output as [Format]..."

- _Why it works:_ This is crucial for getting a response you can actually use.
- _Examples:_ "...a markdown table.", "...a JSON object with keys 'name' and 'email'.", "...a bulleted list."

**6. Tone & Style:** "The tone should be [Tone]..."

- _Why it works:_ Ensures the response matches the intended emotional or stylistic register.
- _Examples:_ "...professional and reassuring.", "...humorous and engaging.", "...formal and academic."

---

### Examples in Action: From Bad to Great

Let's see how these principles transform a prompt.

#### Example 1: Writing an Email

- **Bad (Vague):** "Write an email about the meeting."
- **Better:** "Write a professional email to my team reminding them about the project kick-off meeting next Monday."
- **Great (Using the Formula):**
  > **Role:** You are an efficient project manager.
  > **Context:** Our project "Alpha" is starting, and the kick-off meeting is on Monday, 10 AM in Conference Room B.
  > **Task:** Write a concise email to the development team.
  > **Constraints:** Mention the agenda (goals, timelines, roles). Keep it under 150 words.
  > **Tone:** Professional and enthusiastic.
  > **Format:** Standard email with a subject line, greeting, body, and closing.

#### Example 2: Explaining a Concept

- **Bad (Vague):** "Tell me about photosynthesis."
- **Better:** "Explain photosynthesis simply."
- **Great (Using the Formula):**
  > **Role:** Act as a passionate biology teacher.
  > **Task:** Explain the process of photosynthesis.
  > **Constraints:** Your explanation should be for a 10-year-old student. Use an analogy to make it relatable.
  > **Format:** Structure it in three short paragraphs.

---

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

Once you master the basics, you can try these powerful techniques:

1.  **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Ask the model to "think step by step." This is incredibly effective for complex reasoning, math problems, or code debugging.

    - _Prompt:_ "If a store has 10 apples and sells 3, then buys 5 more, how many does it have? Let's think through this step by step."

2.  **Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting:**

    - **Zero-Shot:** You give a task without examples (all the prompts above are zero-shot).
    - **Few-Shot:** You provide a few examples of the task you want, which teaches the AI the pattern.
      - _Prompt:_
        > "Translate the following English words to French:
        >
        > Example 1: Hello -> Bonjour
        > Example 2: Goodbye -> Au revoir
        >
        > Now translate: Thank you ->"

3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Treat prompting as a conversation. Your first prompt might not be perfect. Analyze the output and refine your prompt.
    - "That's good, but now make it more formal."
    - "Can you add a section about potential risks?"

### A Simple Template to Get Started

Copy and paste this, filling in the brackets:

```
Act as a [role, e.g., expert nutritionist, senior copywriter].
Your task is to [specific task, e.g., create a meal plan, write a social media post].
The context is [background information, e.g., for a client who is vegan and allergic to nuts, for a new coffee shop launch].
Please ensure you [constraints, e.g., provide three options, use hashtags #coffee #grandopening].
The output should be formatted as [format, e.g., a table, a bulleted list].
The tone should be [tone, e.g., friendly and encouraging, professional and authoritative].
```

By following these guidelines, you'll move from getting _randomly okay_ results to getting _precisely what you need_, consistently unlocking the true power of LLMs.

prompt engineering best practices

---

Of course! Here is a comprehensive guide to Prompt Engineering best practices, structured from foundational principles to advanced techniques.

### The Core Mindset: Treat the AI as a Super-Powered Intern

Think of the LLM (Large Language Model) as a brilliant, eager, but sometimes literal-minded intern. They have access to a vast amount of information but no context about _your specific task_. Your job as the prompt engineer is to provide that context with crystal-clear instructions.

---

### 1. The Four Fundamental Principles (The "Four C's")

These are the pillars of effective prompt engineering.

1.  **Be Clear and Specific:** Ambiguity is the enemy of good output. Vague prompts get vague results.
2.  **Provide Context:** Give the model the background information it needs to understand the domain, your goal, and the intended audience.
3.  **Break Down Complex Tasks (Chunking):** Don't ask the model to write a novel in one go. Break it into steps: outline, then chapters, then sections.
4.  **Specify the Format (Constraints):** Tell the model exactly how you want the output structured (e.g., JSON, Markdown, a bulleted list, a Python script).

---

### 2. Practical Techniques & Structures

Here are actionable ways to implement the principles above.

#### A. The "Role-Persona" Pattern

Assign a role to the AI to shape its responses and expertise.

- **Weak Prompt:** "Tell me about cybersecurity."
- **Strong Prompt:** "Act as a seasoned Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) explaining the top 3 cybersecurity threats facing a mid-sized e-commerce company to a non-technical board of directors. Use simple analogies."

#### B. Use Few-Shot and One-Shot Prompting

Provide examples of the input-output pairs you expect. This is one of the most powerful techniques for complex or stylistic tasks.

- **One-Shot:** Provide one example.
- **Few-Shot:** Provide 2-3 examples.

**Example (Text Classification):**

```
Classify the sentiment of these tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Tweet: "I absolutely love the new update! It's so intuitive." Sentiment: Positive
Tweet: "Great, the app is crashing again. Useless." Sentiment: Negative
Tweet: "The new feature was released today." Sentiment: Neutral
Tweet: "This is the best customer service I've ever experienced!" Sentiment:
```

#### C. The "Chain-of-Thought" (CoT) Technique

Force the model to reason step-by-step before giving a final answer. This is crucial for logic, math, and complex reasoning problems.

- **Weak Prompt:** "If a store has 10 apples and sells 4, how many are left?"
- **Strong Prompt:** "If a store has 10 apples and sells 4, how many are left? Let's think through this step by step."

You can also provide examples of CoT reasoning in your few-shot prompts.

#### D. Use Delimiters and Structured Inputs

Use symbols like `###`, `"""`, or XML-style tags to separate different parts of your prompt. This helps the model distinguish between instructions, context, and the input to process.

**Example:**

```
You are a helpful assistant that summarizes text.

TEXT:
"""
[Paste the article or text you want summarized here]
"""

SUMMARY:
```

This structure prevents the model from getting confused about what is an instruction and what is content.

#### E. Iterative Refinement (The Prompting Loop)

Your first prompt is a draft. Rarely is it perfect.

1.  **Write** a prompt.
2.  **Analyze** the output. What's wrong? Too long? Wrong tone? Missing information?
3.  **Refine** the prompt to fix the issue (e.g., add "Be more concise," or "Focus on X and Y").
4.  **Repeat.**

---

### 3. Advanced Strategies

#### A. "Let's think step by step" (Zero-Shot CoT)

A simple but incredibly effective way to trigger reasoning without providing examples. Just appending this phrase to a logic problem often dramatically improves performance.

#### B. Self-Consistency & Validation

Ask the model to generate multiple answers or validate its own work.

- "Generate three different headlines for this blog post."
- "Review the code you just wrote. Are there any syntax errors or potential bugs? List them."

#### C. Using External Knowledge

For tasks requiring up-to-date or specific knowledge, don't rely on the model's internal knowledge (which can be outdated or incorrect). Provide the knowledge in the prompt itself.

- **Instead of:** "What are the Q2 2024 earnings for Company X?"
- **Do:** "Based on the following press release [paste release text], summarize the Q2 2024 earnings for Company X."

---

### 4. Template for a High-Quality Prompt

Use this as a mental checklist when crafting important prompts.

1.  **Role & Persona:** `Act as a [specific role, e.g., expert biologist, sarcastic movie critic].`
2.  **Goal/Task:** `Your task is to [clear action, e.g., explain, write, summarize, classify].`
3.  **Context & Input:** `The context is [background information]. Here is the input: [input data].`
4.  **Step-by-Step Instructions:** `First, do X. Then, do Y. Finally, do Z.`
5.  **Constraints & Format:** `The output must be in [JSON/Table/Markdown]. It must be under 500 words and avoid technical jargon.`
6.  **Exemplars (Optional):** `For example, if the input is "A", the output should be "B".`

**Example Using the Template:**

````
Act as a senior software architect. (1. Role)
Your task is to refactor the following Python function to make it more efficient and readable. (2. Task)
The function is part of a large data processing pipeline, so performance is critical. (3. Context)
Here is the function:
```python
[Paste the existing code here]
```
(3. Input)
First, analyze the code for bottlenecks and style violations. (4. Step 1)
Then, provide the refactored code. (4. Step 2)
Finally, write a brief explanation of the changes you made and why they are an improvement. (4. Step 3)
The output should have three clear sections: 'Analysis', 'Refactored Code', and 'Explanation'. Use markdown headings for each section. (5. Constraints)
````

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Being Too Vague:** "Write something about dogs." -> "Write a 200-word blog post for new pet owners about the benefits of adopting an adult Labrador Retriever."
- **Assuming Knowledge:** The model doesn't know your internal project "Project Phoenix." You must explain what it is.
- **Ascribing Human Feelings:** The model doesn't "think" or "feel." It predicts the next most likely token. Give it clear, objective goals.
- **Giving Up Too Early:** If the first output is bad, refine your prompt. Prompt engineering is an iterative dialogue.

By mastering these practices, you move from just _using_ an AI to effectively _collaborating_ with it, unlocking its full potential for your specific tasks.

revise the prompt.

- the human's description could be anything. human may not know what they really want. it should infer deeply and write best practices by default, assuming the person is (or wanna be) professional and high skilled, but lacks the ability of understand the needs and express clearly to an llm.
- human may offer detailed background infomation, but the output prompt may not include them all by default. it should think how these infomation will affect the output, and describe what the output should be, instead of pasting all these stuff in the prompt, letting llm to interpret when using the prompt.
