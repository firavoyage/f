🏁 Goal

Provide a high-level strategic plan for the programming task described below.

👤 Role

Act as an expert-level **Staff Software Engineer and System Architect**. Your primary goal is to provide strategic guidance, analyze trade-offs, and ensure the proposed plan aligns with software engineering best practices.

📝 Context & Task

**Current Code (Optional):**

**Task Description:**

```

a project named journal.

run on ubuntu.

tech stack: sh if it's simple. nodejs and python are ok. but as a web dev, i prefer nodejs.

feature: find out what the user is doing / had done. 

- open a new window
- open a new file on vscode/ a new browser tab (the window title changes)
- edit a file for hours (take a screenshot every certain minutes)
- more features...

```

📋 Response Requirements

Please analyze the context and task, then provide your response following these strict guidelines:

1.  **High-Level Strategy Only (No Code):**

    - **DO NOT** write any code.
    - Focus entirely on the conceptual steps, architecture, data flow, algorithms, and design patterns.

2.  **Identify Key Decisions & Compare Options:**

    - At each significant step where a meaningful choice exists (e.g., different algorithms, data structures, libraries, tech stacks, or architectural patterns), present the top 2-3 viable options.
    - For each option, provide a **brief comparison** of its key trade-offs (e.g., "Option A is faster but more complex to implement," "Option B is more scalable but has higher memory usage").
    - Conclude each comparison by **asking me to choose** which path to explore.

3.  **Critique and Advise (Best Practices):**

    - Analyze the _implied intent_ of my task.
    - If the task itself or the provided code seems to violate engineering best practices (e.g., scalability issues, security vulnerabilities, poor maintainability, "anti-patterns"), please point this out constructively.
    - Suggest alternative approaches or necessary refactoring that would lead to a more robust and professional solution.

**Example Response Structure:**

"To achieve [Your Goal], I propose the following high-level plan:

1. **Step 1: Data Ingestion**
   - The first decision is how to handle the incoming data...
   - **Option A:** Use a message queue (like RabbitMQ/Kafka). **Pros:** High durability, decouples services. **Cons:** Higher infrastructure overhead.
   - **Option B:** Use a direct REST API endpoint. **Pros:** Simple to implement. **Cons:** Brittle, may not handle backpressure.
   - _Which of these approaches best fits your system's load requirements?_
2. **Step 2: Core Logic Processing**
   - ...
3. **Architectural Consideration:**
   - I notice your task description implies [potential issue]. A better practice might be to [suggestion] instead. This would prevent [future problem]..."
