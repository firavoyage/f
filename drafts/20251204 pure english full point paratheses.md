should i put the full point before or after ")", or both

Great question! The placement of the period depends on whether the parentheses contain a **full sentence** or just a **phrase within a sentence**.

Here are the rules with examples:

### 1. **Parentheses Within a Sentence (Most Common)**

If the words inside the parentheses are **not a complete sentence**, the period goes **after** the closing parenthesis.

> _I need to buy groceries (milk, eggs, and bread)._ > _The meeting is at 3 p.m. (Don't be late!)._

**Logic:** The period ends the main sentence.

### 2. **Parentheses Containing a Full Sentence**

If the parentheses enclose a **complete, standalone sentence**, the period goes **inside** the parentheses.

> _I need to buy groceries. (My list is on the fridge.) Then I'll make dinner._ > _The experiment failed. (We later discovered a calibration error.) This set us back a week._

**Logic:** The period ends the sentence that is inside the parentheses.

### Key Test to Decide:

Read the text **without** the parentheses. If it forms a complete sentence, the period for that main sentence goes **after** the parentheses.

### Special Note: Citations

In academic writing, when citing a source, the period almost always goes **after** the citation parentheses.

> _This theory is widely accepted (Smith, 2020)._ > _The data shows a clear trend (Johnson & Lee, 2019, p. 45)._

**Bottom line:** You almost **never** put a period both before _and_ after `)`. Choose one placement based on the rules above. The most common scenario is the period **after** the `)`.

# 2

what about both (here is a sentence.).

---

No — **never put a period both inside and outside the closing parenthesis.**

That would look like this:  
❌ **`(This is a sentence.).`**

This is redundant and incorrect in standard English punctuation.

**Correct versions would be:**

- If the parentheses contain a **full sentence** and it’s the end of your statement:  
  ✅ `(This is a sentence.)`

- If the parentheses contain **just a phrase within a larger sentence**, the period goes outside:  
  ✅ `This is an example (just a phrase).`

So in your example `(here is a sentence.).`, you should **remove one of the periods**. Choose based on whether the text in parentheses is a full sentence or not.

# 3

the text in parentheses is a full sentence

---

Perfect — then the **period goes inside the parentheses**, and **no period goes outside** (unless there’s another sentence following in the main text).

**Correct:**  
✅ `(Here is a sentence.)`

That’s because the parentheses contain a complete, standalone sentence, and you’re treating it as its own statement inside the parentheses.

---

**If it’s part of a longer sentence**, you wouldn’t capitalize the first word or put a period inside:  
✅ `She explained the rule (here is an example) and then moved on.`

But if you wrote it as **a full sentence in parentheses by itself**, then `(Here is a sentence.)` is correct.

# 4

for example, i love apples (apples are good for our health.).

---

In your example, you have placed the period both inside and outside the closing parenthesis, which is incorrect.

Let's fix it by applying the rules:

### **Your Example:**

`i love apples (apples are good for our health.).`

### **Correction:**

✅ **`I love apples (apples are good for our health).`**

### **Why?**

1.  **Capitalization:** "I" should always be capitalized.
2.  **Parenthesis Content:** The text inside the parentheses (`apples are good for our health`) is a **full sentence**.
3.  **Period Rule:** Because it is a full sentence **and** is included _within_ a larger sentence, you do **not** add a period inside the parentheses. The period for the main sentence goes **after** the closing parenthesis.

**Another correct way to write it, treating the parentheses as a separate, standalone thought, would be:**
✅ **`I love apples. (Apples are good for our health.)`**

In this case, the parenthetical is its own sentence, so it gets a capital letter and its own period inside the parentheses.
