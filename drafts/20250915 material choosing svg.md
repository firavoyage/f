i have a set of points lines circles. i wanna show them on web. should i use canvas of svg?

Excellent question. The choice between Canvas and SVG is one of the most fundamental decisions in web graphics. For a set of points, lines, and circles, **SVG is almost certainly the better choice.**

Here’s a breakdown of why, along with a comparison table and examples.

### The Short Answer

Use **SVG**. Your elements (points, lines, circles) are all primitive shapes that SVG describes natively. SVG is **vector-based**, meaning it scales perfectly without becoming pixelated, and each element is preserved in the Document Object Model (DOM), making it easy to interact with (e.g., hover effects, clicks, dragging).

Use **Canvas** only if you have a _massive_ number of elements (e.g., tens of thousands of points) where performance for rendering static images becomes critical.

### Detailed Comparison

| Feature                | SVG (Vector Graphics)                                                                                                   | Canvas (Raster Graphics)                                                                                                                  | Winner for Your Use Case                          |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Element Type**       | Retains each shape (e.g., `<circle>`, `<line>`) as an object in the DOM.                                                | **Pixels on a bitmap.** Once something is drawn, it's forgotten. You only have a flat image.                                              | **SVG** (You want to keep your shapes as objects) |
| **Scalability**        | **Perfectly scalable.** Looks crisp at any size or zoom level.                                                          | Becomes pixelated (**blurry**) when scaled up.                                                                                            | **SVG**                                           |
| **Interactivity**      | **Excellent.** Native support for mouse events (click, hover) on each individual shape. Easy with CSS and JavaScript.   | **Very difficult.** You must manually track mouse position and math to see if it's over a drawn element.                                  | **SVG**                                           |
| **Performance**        | Slower with a _very_ large number of objects (e.g., >1000 complex shapes) because the browser manages many DOM objects. | **Extremely fast** for drawing a huge number of items (e.g., data visualizations with 10k+ points). Best for games or complex animations. | _Canvas, but you likely don't need this._         |
| **What it's good for** | Interactive diagrams, charts, maps, icons, UIs. **Your use case fits perfectly here.**                                  | Complex animations, video games, image manipulation, pixel-based operations.                                                              | **SVG**                                           |

### Code Examples

Let's see how you would create two circles and a line connecting them in both technologies.

#### 1. SVG Example (Recommended)

```html
<svg width="200" height="200" style="border: 1px solid grey;">
  <!-- A Line -->
  <line x1="50" y1="50" x2="150" y2="150" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />

  <!-- Circle 1 -->
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="10" fill="red" />

  <!-- Circle 2 -->
  <circle cx="150" cy="150" r="10" fill="blue" />
</svg>
```

**Why this is great:**

- You can easily add a hover effect with CSS:
  ```css
  circle:hover {
    fill: purple;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  ```
- You can attach click events in JavaScript directly to each circle:
  ```javascript
  document.querySelector("circle").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
    alert("Circle 1 was clicked!");
  });
  ```
- You can easily drag the circles around with a library like [draggable](https://draggable.github.io/draggable/).

#### 2. Canvas Example (Not Recommended)

```html
<canvas
  id="myCanvas"
  width="200"
  height="200"
  style="border: 1px solid grey;"
></canvas>

<script>
  const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

  // Draw a line
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(50, 50);
  ctx.lineTo(150, 150);
  ctx.strokeStyle = "black";
  ctx.lineWidth = 2;
  ctx.stroke();

  // Draw Circle 1
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(50, 50, 10, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = "red";
  ctx.fill();

  // Draw Circle 2
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(150, 150, 10, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = "blue";
  ctx.fill();

  // --- Adding interactivity is HARD ---
  // You have to add a mouse event listener to the entire canvas
  canvas.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
    const mouseX = event.clientX - rect.left;
    const mouseY = event.clientY - rect.top;

    // Check if the click was on circle 1 (using distance formula)
    const dist = Math.sqrt((mouseX - 50) ** 2 + (mouseY - 50) ** 2);
    if (dist < 10) {
      alert("Circle 1 was clicked!");
    }
    // You would need to repeat this for every single object on the canvas!
  });
</script>
```

**Why this is worse for your task:** The code is longer, and adding simple interactions becomes a complex mathematical chore.

### Advanced Consideration: Libraries

For both technologies, libraries can make your life much easier:

- **For SVG:** Use **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)**. It is the industry standard for creating rich, interactive, data-driven SVG visualizations. It handles the creation, update, and animation of SVG elements based on data seamlessly. It has a learning curve but is incredibly powerful.
- **For Canvas:** Use **[Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)** or **[Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/)**. These libraries add an object model on top of Canvas, making it easier to handle individual shapes and interactions, almost making it work like SVG. Use these if you _must_ use Canvas for performance but still need interactivity.

### Final Recommendation

**Start with SVG.** It is the perfect tool for your job. It's easier to implement, inherently interactive, and resolution-independent.

Only consider switching to Canvas (potentially with a library like Paper.js) if you run into performance issues because you are rendering an _extremely_ large number of elements that need to be animated rapidly. For most use cases involving points, lines, and circles, this will not be the case.

whats the choice of popular web apps, like figma, math fn render tool, drawio...

---

Excellent question. The choice made by popular web apps reveals a lot about the trade-offs in real-world, high-performance applications. The landscape is more nuanced than a simple "SVG vs. Canvas" dichotomy.

Here’s a breakdown of what these popular apps use and why:

---

### 1. Figma / Excalidraw / Miro (Vector Design & Whiteboarding)

**Technology: [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) + Canvas**

- **Why?** **Sheer scale and performance.** These apps need to handle complex documents with thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of objects (shapes, paths, text elements). They require:
  - **60fps rendering:** For buttery-smooth zooming, panning, and dragging of incredibly complex scenes.
  - **GPU acceleration:** WebGL allows them to offload rendering calculations to the user's graphics card (GPU), which is built for massive parallel processing.
  - **Custom rendering engines:** They essentially implement their own highly optimized rendering logic, bypassing the browser's built-in SVG or Canvas 2D renderer for critical operations.

**They don't use SVG** because the DOM overhead of managing hundreds of thousands of `<path>` or `<rect>` elements would bring the browser to its knees. The DOM is just not designed for that level of dynamic, performance-critical graphics.

**They don't use Canvas 2D** because, while faster than SVG for drawing many objects, its CPU-based rendering is still not fast enough for the extreme performance demands of a professional design tool.

### 2. Draw.io / diagrams.net (Diagramming)

**Technology: SVG**

- **Why?** This is a classic perfect use case for SVG. Diagrams are made of distinct, interactive objects (nodes, lines, text) that users need to select, edit, and move.
  - **Built-in Interactivity:** Getting click, hover, and drag events for free from the DOM is a huge development win.
  - **Crisp Output:** The primary output of a diagram is often a PDF or image, and SVG scales to any resolution perfectly.
  - **Manageable Scale:** Most diagrams have dozens or hundreds of elements, not hundreds of thousands. SVG handles this scale beautifully without performance issues.

### 3. Desmos / GeoGebra (Math Function Rendering)

**Technology: Canvas**

- **Why?** These apps are essentially plotting massive amounts of data points.
  - **Number of Elements:** A single plotted function might be rendered by evaluating thousands of (x, y) points and connecting them with line segments. This is far too many individual elements for SVG to manage performantly.
  - **Static vs. Interactive:** While the graph itself is highly interactive (zooming, panning), the individual points and line segments don't need to be _individually_ interactive. The interaction is with the graph _as a whole_. Canvas is perfect for rapidly clearing and redrawing the entire scene as the user zooms or pans.
  - **Performance for Animation:** Smoothly animating a parameter changing a function requires redrawing the entire graph at 60fps. Canvas is optimized for this "draw, clear, redraw" loop.

### 4. Exceptions and Hybrids

Many modern apps use a **hybrid approach**:

- **Figma:** Uses WebGL for the main design canvas but uses **SVG + DOM** for the UI surrounding the canvas (toolbars, menus, the properties panel). They might also use SVG to render individual icons within the UI.
- **Google Maps:** Uses a hybrid where the base map tiles are raster images (like a Canvas), but interactive overlays like markers, routes, and shapes are often **SVG elements** positioned on top so they can be easily interacted with and scaled.

| **Desmos**      | **Canvas**                                    | Rendering 10,000+ data points for a function plot; no need for per-element interaction. |
| **Google Maps** | **Hybrid** (Raster Tiles + SVG/HTML Overlays) | Performance for base map + interactivity for markers.                                   |

### Conclusion and Advice for You

For your project with points, lines, and circles, the choice still hinges on **scale and interactivity**:

1.  **For a small to medium number of elements (<1000) where you need rich interaction** (selecting, dragging, hovering, right-clicking on individual circles): **Use SVG**. It's the right tool for the job and will be much easier to develop. A library like **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)** is your best friend here.

2.  **For a very large number of elements (>5000) where the image is mostly static or the interaction is with the whole scene** (like panning and zooming a massive graph): **Use Canvas**. You might even look into a library like **[PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/)** (which uses WebGL under the hood) if you need high performance for animations.

3.  **If you somehow anticipate building the next Figma** and need to render hundreds of thousands of objects with perfect performance: **Start learning WebGL** (via [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) or directly).
