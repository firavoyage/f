compare how would you do something and how would you like to do something

---

That's a fantastic question because it gets to the heart of the gap between reality and aspiration—between the _practical_ and the _ideal_.

Here’s a breakdown of the comparison, using a general task as an example: **"Creating a presentation for a client."**

### How I Would **Actually** Do It (The Pragmatic, Real-World Method)

This is governed by constraints: time, resources, tools, and existing expectations.

1.  **Define the Goal Efficiently:** I'd quickly confirm the objective and key message with the stakeholder, often via a brief email or chat.
2.  **Leverage Templates & Past Work:** I'd start with a company template to ensure brand consistency and look for past successful presentations for structure and tone.
3.  **Prioritize Speed & Clarity:** I'd focus on getting the core content down clearly first. I might use placeholder images or basic charts.
4.  **Solo or Siloed Work:** Initial drafting is often done alone. Collaboration happens in defined review cycles (e.g., sharing a draft for comments).
5.  **Use Standard Tools:** I'd rely on the standard software my company uses (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides) because everyone has access and knows how to edit it.
6.  **Iterate Based on Feedback:** I'd send a "good enough" draft for review, expecting a few rounds of changes from various stakeholders.
7.  **Final Polish Under Time Pressure:** Final edits, proofreading, and formatting tweaks often happen right before the deadline.

**Driving Force:** **Efficiency and feasibility.** The goal is to produce a solid, professional result that meets requirements within the given constraints.

### How I Would **Like** to Do It (The Ideal, High-Impact Method)

This is governed by values: depth, creativity, collaboration, and impact.

1.  **Deep Discovery Phase:** I'd prefer to start with a real conversation—or even a workshop—with the client to understand not just their stated need, but their deeper challenges, fears, and aspirations.
2.  **Create from a Blank Slate (or Custom Design):** I'd like to design a unique narrative and visual structure tailored specifically to _that_ client's story, even if it means creating new templates.
3.  **Prioritize Storytelling & Emotion:** Before adding bullet points, I'd craft a compelling narrative arc. I'd want to find powerful, custom imagery or data visualizations that evoke the right feeling.
4.  **Co-Creation & Continuous Collaboration:** I'd prefer to work in a "war room" style with the team (strategist, designer, subject expert) from the start, building the presentation together in real-time.
5.  **Use the Best Tool for the Story:** If the story is better told with an interactive prototype, a short video, or a Prezi-like dynamic canvas, I'd like the freedom to choose that tool.
6.  **Prototype and Test:** I'd love to test the presentation's core message and flow with a small, friendly audience before finalizing it, refining based on their emotional and intellectual response.
7.  **Practice and Refine Delivery:** The ideal process includes dedicated time to rehearse not just _what_ to say, but _how_ to say it—to make the delivery as impactful as the slides.

**Driving Force:** **Effectiveness and artistry.** The goal is to create a transformative experience that deeply resonates, persuades, and is memorable.

### The Essential Comparison Table

| Aspect               | **How I _Would_ Do It (Reality)**      | **How I _Would Like_ to Do It (Ideal)** |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Core Driver**      | Efficiency, Constraints, Practicality  | Creativity, Depth, Maximum Impact       |
| **Starting Point**   | Template & Past Examples               | Blank Slate & Client Discovery          |
| **Process**          | Linear, Segmented Phases               | Iterative, Collaborative, Integrated    |
| **Focus**            | Clarity, Completeness, Professionalism | Storytelling, Emotion, Memorability     |
| **Tools**            | Standard, Ubiquitous Software          | Best Tool for the Narrative             |
| **Collaboration**    | Reviews & Feedback Cycles              | Continuous Co-Creation                  |
| **Time & Resources** | The Primary Limiting Factors           | Ample and Flexible                      |

### Why the Gap Exists & How to Bridge It

The gap exists because of real-world pressures: **limited time, budget, organizational culture, and immediate demands.**

You can bridge it by:

- **Starting with the Ideal:** Use the "like to do" method as a vision. What's the **one element** from that column you can incorporate this time? Maybe it's starting with a 15-minute discovery call instead of an email.
- **Advocating for Value:** Explain how the ideal method (e.g., deeper discovery) leads to better outcomes (e.g., a more persuasive pitch, higher client satisfaction).
- **Iterating Toward the Ideal:** Each time you do the task, try to improve one step of the process slightly, moving it closer to your ideal.

In short, **"how I would do it" is often a series of necessary compromises, while "how I would like to do it" is the true north—a guide for what to strive for when circumstances allow.** The best professionals navigate the first while keeping the second firmly in sight.
