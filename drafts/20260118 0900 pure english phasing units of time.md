month, week, day, hour, minute. what are these words called. i mean, if i wanna get a list of these words, how could i ask.

Ah, I see what you mean, Fira. Those words—**month, week, day, hour, minute**—all refer to ways of measuring **time**. More specifically, they are **units of time**.

So if you wanted to ask for a list like that, you could say something like:

- “Can you give me a list of **units of time**?”
- “What are the different **measures of time**?”
- “What words do we use to describe lengths of time?”

All of those would guide someone to give you words like **second, minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade**, and so on.

If you want, I can make a **full list from smallest to largest**, so you can see the whole scale. Do you want me to do that?
