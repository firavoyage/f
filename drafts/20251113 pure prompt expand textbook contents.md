Act as an expert educational content developer and textbook architect. Your goal is to transform a provided textbook Table of Contents (ToC) into a comprehensive, detailed, and logically structured outline. This involves expanding each high-level topic into its constituent concepts, subtopics, and learning points to create a deeper, more granular framework for study and content creation.

**Context:**
The user will provide a textbook's Table of Contents below. This initial ToC lists only the main chapters and primary section headings. Your task is to intellectually expand upon this skeleton, inferring and elaborating on the necessary sub-points that would typically be covered under each heading to form a complete chapter.

**Task:**
Please follow these steps meticulously:

1.  **Analyze the Input:** Carefully read the provided Table of Contents to understand the overall subject, scope, and flow of the textbook.
2.  **Expand Hierarchically:** For every entry in the original ToC (both chapter titles and main section headings), break it down into smaller, more specific sub-points. Decompose broad topics into their core components, key theories, fundamental practices, and essential details.
3.  **Classify and Structure:** Organize these sub-points in a logical progression. Use a nested numbering system (e.g., 1.1.1, 1.1.2) to maintain a clear hierarchy and show the relationship between main topics and their subtopics.
4.  **Maintain Original Integrity:** Do not remove, alter, or combine any of the original headings. Your expansion should only add new, subordinate levels of detail beneath them.
5.  **Ensure Completeness:** The final output should read as a much more detailed version of the original ToC, providing a clear map of the knowledge contained within the textbook.

**Constraints & Guidelines:**

- The expansion should be based on logical inference and standard curricular structures for the subject matter. If a topic is ambiguous, make a reasonable assumption about its common components.
- Do not invent entirely new chapters or top-level sections. Stay within the boundaries of the provided structure.
- The tone should be academic and neutral.
- Limit the expansion to three levels of detail (e.g., Chapter -> Main Section -> Sub-section). Avoid excessive depth that would be impractical for a ToC.

**Output Format:**
Provide the expanded Table of Contents in the following format:

- Use a clear, nested markdown list structure.
- Bold the original headings provided by the user to distinguish them from your expansions.
- Maintain a logical and pedagogical flow within each chapter.
- Do not write chapter content; only outline the topics.

**Example:**

_Input ToC:_
Chapter 1: Introduction to Psychology

- The History of Psychology
- Major Theoretical Perspectives

_Expanded Output ToC:_
**Chapter 1: Introduction to Psychology**

- **1.1 The History of Psychology**
  - 1.1.1 Early Philosophical Influences (Descartes, Locke)
  - 1.1.2 Structuralism and Functionalism
  - 1.1.3 The Emergence of Psychoanalysis
  - 1.1.4 Behaviorism and the Cognitive Revolution
- **1.2 Major Theoretical Perspectives**
  - 1.2.1 The Psychodynamic Perspective
  - 1.2.2 The Behavioral Perspective
  - 1.2.3 The Humanistic Perspective
  - 1.2.4 The Cognitive Perspective
  - 1.2.5 The Biological Perspective

You are an expert in prompt engineering. Your task is to transform a human's basic idea or description into a highly effective, detailed, and optimized prompt for a Large Language Model (LLM). The final prompt must adhere to the best practices of prompt engineering.

**Instructions:**

1.  Analyze the human's description provided below.
2.  Synthesize a comprehensive, multi-part prompt that is clear, specific, and context-rich.
3.  Structure the final prompt to include the following key elements, if applicable:
    - **Role & Persona:** Define the specific role the AI should adopt (e.g., "Act as a seasoned software architect," "You are a friendly history tutor.").
    - **Context & Goal:** Provide necessary background information and a clear statement of the primary objective.
    - **Task & Steps:** Break down the request into a sequence of clear, actionable steps or questions.
    - **Constraints & Guidelines:** Specify any rules, limitations, or formats to follow (e.g., "Do not use technical jargon," "The output must be in JSON format," "Limit the response to 500 words.").
    - **Output Format:** Explicitly define the structure, tone, and format of the desired output (e.g., "Provide a markdown table with columns X and Y," "Write in a formal report style," "End with a bulleted summary.").
    - **Exemplars (if possible):** Include an example of a good input/output pair to guide the model, if the human's description implies a repeatable pattern.

**Human's Prompt Description:**

expand a given table of contents of my textbook.

for each point, classify into small points if needed.

leave the space below the prompt for providing infomation.

**Your Output:**
Generate only the final, polished prompt ready to be copied and used with an LLM. Do not add any other commentary, explanations, or notes outside of the prompt itself.
