对于成熟的且前人之述备矣的学科，新加入的教科书作者有一个回避不了的问题，那就是读者凭什么要在你的作品上花费时间和金钱呢？

这个问题徐一鸿回答过，Weinberg 也回答过。关于为什么要写自己的量子场论教科书，他们的回答是 “I wrote the book that I would have liked to learn from.” 他们是在形成自己的思想体系后，在清楚地知道前人作品的局限性的前提下，去尽力创作另一个时空中作为初学者的自己能够喜欢甚至偏爱的书。
这种动机，跟利用微不足道的知识差在懵懂的初学者群体中炫耀甚至吸金的动机相比，完全是云泥之别。

Maki‘s Lab 的作者扪心自问，你们真的喜欢自己写的东西吗？你们愿意当年作为初学者的自己用这些书去学习吗？

i could not justify chinese education. and no one really could.

but i wont say something. not for the censorship. but,

from the scarcity and the massive population, there definitely will be a lot of people not getting well paid, while being (somewhat decently) educated, learning a lot of (not all) useless knowledge, who must believe that's right for the stability of the country, which overpowers any human right of anyone, due to the patriotism education. even some of them, even from a poor background, are wise enough to get rid and get beyond, without going on the normal and boring path. most of them wont. that's what mediocrity/ordinarity/philistine means. that's stats.

as one who believes existentialism, determinism, (maybe cynicism, and accerationism), i wont try to do anything for the sake of helping people. the world is the world itself. the world could not be changed.

- the flow of life is endless. the universe is vast, humans are small.
- if eistein does not get born, someone else will eventually find her observations. i dont believe "the more i know, the more idk.". i believe the truth is always getting brighter, and more complex for the comers.

anaylzing, the education in the underdeveloped areas is not a gamble. even if you go to one of the top universities, it does not worth. you learn more. you do better in a competition. but life is not a competition. the world is not, either. holding more unrelated knowledge does not mean you could do something you could not previously, and dots dont necessarily connect in the future.

the education system is selecting people more than (or instead of) educating.

more grounded, i will claim

- the textbook is not well written for contests. only if you are one of the smart guys could you really understand them, and summarize the patterns by themselves from problems and papers.
- most teachers are not good teachers.
- students should rest well to study well.
- most knowledge are no needed.
- english is good if you want to breathe in the free world. logical thinking is good if you want to make wise choices, or you will learn from the reality in a hard way someday. art and culture are beautiful and inspiring. i mean learning, not schooling.

that's it. although pointing them out is useless. everyone knows that. everyone knows there exists some people that would never know or escape.

for myself, i could be better than most (ofc not all) people sometimes in contests. but that does not mean i could leverage these knowledge. and so im not willing to pay time in it.

about pure project: practice activism/accerationism and let's see what the final sparkle would be. let the world know about the domestic education. our generation should not be forgotten. also, at the beginning (at its heart), it's idealism "create something fira would love". it's fira's memories "for fira, the grade 10 innocent girl".
