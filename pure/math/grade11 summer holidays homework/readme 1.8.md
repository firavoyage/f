皆さん、こんにちは。

fira です。

this is an editorial of guided learning pioneer summer holidays problemset on math of grade 11 in 2025.

unlike other vids, fira will probably not use clickbait titles and covers coz the book itself doesnt have many users. let's say it's a memory archive.

the editorial will cover most last problems of a unit.

other problems, even more difficult ones are not going to be solved coz fira practices math just for fun and yeah, fira is too lazy to select problems.

here we go! unit 1 problem 8, the first problem. (warau) i will use chinese btw.
